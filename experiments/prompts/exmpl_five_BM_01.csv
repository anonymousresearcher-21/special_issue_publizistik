EXMPL1,include,"Biased Representation of Politicians in Google and Wikipedia Search? The Joint Effect of Party Identity, Gender Identity and Elections","Web search engines have become an important and trusted source when people seek political information. Even though previous research suggests that information about politicians in traditional and new media can provide content that makes stereotypes based on gender and party, little is known about the presence of such bias in search engines, which function as information gatekeepers in the digital age. Using quantitative text analysis and human coding techniques on a novel data set of members of the German parliament, this study examines whether search engine suggestions, i.e. search predictions, for politicians differ with respect to personal and role-oriented information based on the gender and party of the politician. It also explores whether the search engine representation of politicians changes around elections. The study further compares gender and party differences in search engine results with corresponding Wikipedia articles of the same politicians, as users are most often redirected to Wikipedia from Google. The results suggest that politicians representation in search engines and Wikipedia are structured by a joint effect of their gender and party identity. While Google suggestions provide less personal information about female politicians belonging to a right-wing party compared to their male counterparts, this relationship is not observable for left-wing parties. Moreover, there are changes in gender biases around the election. In Wikipedia articles, politicians belonging to right-wing parties are represented with more personal information compared to politicians belonging to left ones, an effect which is even stronger for females.",include,,
EXMPL2,include,Does Use of Emotion Increase Donations and Volunteers for Nonprofits?,"Nonprofits offer services to disadvantaged populations, mobilize collective action, and advocate for civil rights. Conducting this work requires significant resources, raising the question: how do nonprofits succeed in increasing donations and volunteers amid widespread competition for these resources? Much research treats nonprofits as cold, rational entities, focusing on overhead, the price of donations, and efficiency in programming. We argue that nonprofits attract donors and volunteers by connecting to their emotions. We use newly available administrative IRS 990 e-filer data to analyze 90,000 nonprofit missions from 2012 to 2016. Computational text analysis measures the positive or negative affect of each nonprofits mission statement. We then link the positive and negative sentiment expressed by nonprofits to their donations and volunteers. We differentiate between the institutional fields of nonprofits-for example, arts, education, social welfare-distinguishing nonprofits focused on social bonding from those focused on social problems. We find that expressed positive emotion is often associated with higher donations and volunteers, especially in bonding fields. But for some types of nonprofits, combining positive sentiment with negative sentiment in a mission statement is most effective in producing volunteers. Auxiliary analyses using experimental and longitudinal designs provide converging evidence that emotional language enhances charitable behavior. Understanding the role of emotion can help nonprofit organizations attract and engage volunteers and donors.",include,,
EXMPL3,include,You've got mail: how the Trump administration used legislative communication to frame his last year in office,"Legislative communication frames how constituents perceive politicians successes. However, most research on legislative communication focuses on Congressional or Senatorial email correspondence, without considering the importance of presidential emails or the way politicians frame their failures...",include,,
EXMPL4,include,Twitter made me do it! Twitter's tonal platform incentive and its effect on online campaigning,"Legislative communication frames how constituents perceive politicians' successes. However, most research on legislative communication focuses on Congressional or Senatorial email correspondence, without considering the importance of presidential emails or the way politicians frame their failures. Existing work on legislative communication also tends to analyze the documents in isolation, leaving open the opportunity to analyze the networked effect of information flows. To fill this gap, we analyze a year of 1600 Daily content - The Official White House email style newsletter created by the Obama Administration and subsequently adopted after the Trump administration took office. In doing so, we identify the central frames the Trump White House relied on leading up to the 2020 election and the media sources used to legitimize these claims. Drawing on frequency counts, structural topic modeling, and qualitative content analysis, our data reveal the important role electoral communication plays in framing current events and the extent to which email is an essential node in the right-wing media ecosystem.",include,,
EXMPL5,include,Playing to the Gallery: Emotive Rhetoric in Parliaments,"Research has shown that emotions matter in politics, but we know less about when and why politicians use emotive rhetoric in the legislative arena. This article argues that emotive rhetoric is one of the tools politicians can use strategically to appeal to voters. Consequently, we expect that legislators are more likely to use emotive rhetoric in debates that have a large general audience. Our analysis covers two million parliamentary speeches held in the UK House of Commons and the Irish Parliament. We use a dictionary-based method to measure emotive rhetoric, combining the Affective Norms for English Words dictionary with word-embedding techniques to create a domain-specific dictionary. We show that emotive rhetoric is more pronounced in high-profile legislative debates, such as Prime Ministers Questions. These findings contribute to the study of legislative speech and political representation by suggesting that emotive rhetoric is used by legislators to appeal directly to voters.",include,,
EXMPL6,exclude,Meaning Multiplicity Across Communication Subfields: Bridging the Gaps,"Subdisciplines in communication studies have developed competing and self-contained theories of meaning multiplicity. Arguing that this fragmented scholarship falls short of grasping the full scope of the phenomenon, this article offers Decoding Convergence-Divergence (DCD) as an interdisciplinary analytical and conceptual framework. Synthesizing principles from cognitive, cultural, and speaker-centered approaches to meaning multiplicity, this framework was applied in a study that examined news coverage of a CEOs initiative to address income inequality and its reception by different segments of the American audience. The studys results provide a novel demonstration of the joint contribution of opposing theories to the understanding of meaning multiplicity. Specifically, it found that textual polysemy, partisan selective perception, and the use of strategic ambiguity coalesced in the interpretive dynamics of this story. Based on these results, the article discusses the contribution of DCD to bridging competing approaches and the potential applications of the framework.",exclude,,
EXMPL7,exclude,"Nondomination or Practices of Freedom? French Muslim Women, Foucault, and The Full Veil Ban","This article proposes a conception of freedom understood as practices. Based on Michel Foucaults work on the ethics of the self, I develop a conception of freedom that exceeds liberation and distinguishes between genuine practices of freedom and practices of the self that are unreflective responses to systems of government. I develop and illustrate this conception through an engagement with the recent French ban on full veils in public spaces and the ethnographic literature on European Muslim revival movements. I reconstruct how Muslim women relate to alternative discourses through specific practices of the self. These practices reveal that French Muslim women actively contest discourses of secularism and liberation that construct them as inherently passive and in need of tutelage. The conception I develop sheds light on some shortcomings of Philip Pettits notion of freedom as nondomination. I argue that the proposed account is useful to, first, criticize the centrality of the opposition between arbitrary and nonarbitrary power in the definition of freedom. Second, I show that the predominant engagement with the external dimension of freedom in Pettit makes it difficult to capture the particular subjective practices that make up freedom and its development in the presence of power and/or attempts at domination.",exclude,,
EXMPL8,exclude,How Do They Debunk Fake News? A Cross-National Comparison of Transparency in Fact Checks,"Fact-checking has gained importance in recent years, as so-called fake news has started to spread on social media. News outlets and independent organizations engage in debunking to combat the massive spread of disinformation. However, several authors have argued that fact checkers can only be successful if they win the trust of the audience - by making their practices transparent. This article analyzes the degree of source transparency provided by eight fact checkers from different countries (the US, the UK, Germany, and Austria). The findings show major differences among the outlets studied which can be attributed to varying levels of journalistic professionalism as well as to organizational differences. Implications for the success of fact-checking and solutions to combat online disinformation are discussed.",exclude,,
EXMPL9,exclude,JOURNALISM AS CULTURES OF CIRCULATION,"The universe of journalism has always consisted of interspersed texts, practices and meanings. Yet, much journalism research has often isolated either texts and/or contexts and thus assumed relations between professional practices, informed (rational) readers and (conceived) core texts. It is, however, more important than ever to shift attention away from texts to the processes through which they are circulated. This is partly because the many cultural forms of journalism (textual, institutional, technological, material, behavioural and imagined) are undergoing significant changes, one of which is being interrelated in new and increasingly complex ways. To understand some of the related processes, this article proposes a notion of circulation that implies a close attention to the ways in which the various forms of this landscape travel, intertwine and connect and, in particular, to the ways in which these forms construct and maintain what is termed cultures of circulation. In order to approach such processes, this article traces the photographic mediation of a specific event with the overall aim of beginning a theorization of the landscape of journalism as interrelated cultures of circulation.",exclude,,
EXMPL10,exclude,Sustaining a democratic innovation: a study of three e-participatory budgets in Belo Horizonte,"This article explores the transition from democratic innovation to institutionalised political process of e-participatory budgeting in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Applying a multimethod approach (content analysis, interviews and social media monitoring) regarding the last three editions (2008, 2011 and 2013), it considers how the proponents and organisers of ePB conceive its function in relation to the representative mechanisms that surround it; how the citizens of Belo Horizonte have responded to it in relation to their experience of being represented; and how governments seeking to institutionalise democratic innovations with a view to establishing more direct forms of representation might learn from this exercise.",exclude,,
