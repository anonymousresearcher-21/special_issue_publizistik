IC1,inclusion,Use of Computational Text Analysis Methods (CTAM),Study must use algorithms or automated software tools to analyze textual data (written or spoken language). The analysis should involve computational methods beyond simple word counting.,"INCLUDE: Machine learning for text classification, automated content analysis, topic modeling | EXCLUDE: Manual content analysis, purely qualitative text analysis",
IC2,inclusion,Analysis of social science constructs,Study must measure at least one latent social science construct through CTAM. Constructs can range from abstract to multidimensional concepts.,"INCLUDE: Sentiment analysis, ideology measurement, communication style analysis, populism detection | EXCLUDE: Simple frequency counts, basic descriptive statistics",
IC3,inclusion,Political communication focus,"Study must address empirical, theory-driven research questions in political communication.","INCLUDE: Analysis of political discourse, media framing of political issues, political ideology detection | EXCLUDE: Technical method papers without political communication focus",
EC1,exclusion,Non-computational methods,Studies that do not use computational methods for text analysis or rely primarily on manual coding.,"EXCLUDE: Manual content analysis, purely qualitative discourse analysis, human coding without computational components",
EC2,exclusion,No social science construct measurement,Studies that do not measure any latent social science constructs or only perform basic text statistics.,"EXCLUDE: Word frequency counts only, readability metrics only, simple descriptive text statistics",
EC3,exclusion,Methodological focus only,Studies that focus solely on developing or comparing CTAM methods without substantive research questions.,"EXCLUDE: Papers only comparing different algorithms, technical validation studies without empirical application",
EC4,exclusion,Non-political communication,Studies that apply CTAM outside the field of political communication.,"EXCLUDE: Marketing text analysis, literary analysis, general linguistics studies without political focus",
