EXMPL1,include,How keeping up DIVERSifies: Watching public affairs TV in the Netherlands 1988-2010,"Although concerns have been raised that political infotainment programmes might increasingly substitute more serious information, empirical evidence about changes of individual viewing behaviour is scarce. The authors discuss audience specialization and diversification as two opposing patterns of audience response to a growing variety of public affairs programmes. While specialization results from selective programme choice, diversification may be furthered by the impact of situational factors. Using electronically recorded people-meter data, this study explores information viewing in the Netherlands over the last two decades. As opposed to concerns about audience fragmentation, the authors find that public affairs viewing has become more diverse on the individual level with entertaining information programmes used as an additional source of information. Dutch viewers were exposed to different public affairs information. The personal relevance of TV as a medium is one of the main drivers behind high levels of exposure.",include,,
EXMPL2,exclude,A primary definer online: the construction and propagation of a think tanks authority on SOCIAL MEDIA,"Who has power in the construction of economic news in the United Kingdom? Are social media reshaping how this power is enabled? We examine the public Twitter interactions between journalists, political elites and, what is arguably the United Kingdoms most important think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), during the 2015 UK general election campaign. Combining human-coded content analysis and network analysis of Twitter discourse about the IFS during a 38-day period, we explain how and why the authority of this think tank is being translated to social media. We develop a new, social media theory of primary definers and show how the political authority on which such roles rest is co-constructed and propagated by professional journalists and political elites. Central to this process is a behaviour we conceptualize and measure: authority signalling. Our findings call into question some of the more sanguine generalizations about social medias contribution to pluralist democracy. Given the dominance of public service broadcasters in the processes we identify, we argue that, despite the growth of social media, there can be surprising limits on the extent to which contemporary media systems help citizens gain information about the assumptions underlying economic policy.",exclude,,
EXMPL3,include,Combating MEDIA concentration by the german market share model,"The media sector is traditionally characterized by a comparatively strong horizontal, vertical and diagonal concentration. This enables media suppliers to render economic competition ineffective and to restrict the variety and plurality of media content. To prevent this, many countries have induced media law restrictions of concentration extending beyond general antitrust laws. In Germany in accordance with the so-called market share model the Interstate Broadcasting Agreement (""Rundfunkstaats-vertrag"") presumes a ""controlling influence"" if the programs attributable to a television company achieve an average annual viewer rating of 30{\%}. In this case any further external growth is to be denied, and appropriate steps must be taken to eliminate its controlling influence. The optimal value for this market share ceiling in this paper is determined in a model theory approach by balancing the benefits and costs of concentration restrictions and by selecting the value at which the benefit surplus is at its highest. However, as the effects of national concentration restrictions often are not limited to the jurisdictions that determine its intensity, there will be (spatial) external effects, due to which national decisions systematically diverge from the social optimum. From this perspective the successive replacement of national by supranational concentration control is necessary in the course of globalizing media markets.",include,,
EXMPL4,include,MEDIA freedom and pluralism: legislation and enforcement at the European level,"This paper attempts to put European media freedom and pluralism into the context of European legislation and law-enforcement. It analyses how the European Convention on Human Rights can protect media freedom and pluralism, and whether and how the European Union has the obligation and the competence to do so. It argues that protecting media pluralism in Europe is an even more urgent need than reacting to individual violations of freedom of expression, because structural distortions to media markets have reached a level constituting a deficiency in European democratic processes. The legal insecurity around social network sites increases the extent of the crisis: which involves the failure of the medias functioning as the watchdog of the governments.",include,,
EXMPL5,include,The political and ideological dimension of the measurement of freedom of information. Assessing the interplay between neoliberalism and the freedom of the press index,"The article aims to analyse the role of measurement in legitimising a specific conception of freedom of information. From a neo-Gramscian perspective, the work draws attention to the way a political and ideological paradigm influences measuring instruments, as well as the contribution of such tools in strengthening the hegemony of that paradigm. By illustrating the rise of neoliberalism as a case in point, the study hypothesises a neoliberal influence on the measurement of freedom of information. To test such assumption, the work describes three ideal typical models of freedom of information the liberal, egalitarian and neoliberal models - and their connection with specific conceptions of democracy. Then, the article focuses on the Freedom of the Press Index by Freedom House, that is the most used and recognised instrument for measuring freedom of information. Though the Freedom House contends to measure a liberal conception of freedom of information, the analysis of the indicators of the Freedom of the Press Index shows that they mirror the neoliberal model at least with respect to the role of State and Market on media systems, and the conception of media pluralism. The results bring into question the uncritical acceptance of the Freedom of the Press Index as the universal yardstick of freedom of information.",include,,
EXMPL6,include,MEDIA Ownership and Public Service NEWS: How Strong Are Institutional Logics?,"This article analyzes the extent to which diverse institutional logics (stock market, privately held, civil society, public) are linked to the exercise of one important mode of media ownership power: public service orientation. The research draws on a content analysis of a total of fifty-one news organizations in Sweden, France, and the United States, representing, respectively, Hallin and Mancinis democratic corporatist, polarized pluralist, and liberal models. We find that two types of institutional logics—affordance and homogenization—shape the amount and type of public-service-oriented news. On average, public-service-oriented news was highest at civil-society-owned media, but there was significant variation within this category: We call this kind of institutional logic an affordance logic because it affords but does not guarantee a certain kind of news content. Public media, on the other hand, exhibited the least deviation across outlets within each country, thus exemplifying a strong homogenization logic. All forms of ownership, but especially privately held and civil society media, exhibited significant variations across individual organizations. Economic field dominance, as in the United States, did not produce greater homogenization across ownership fields as predicted by field theory.",include,,
EXMPL7,exclude,"Communication, community, crisis: Mapping uses and gratifications in the contemporary MEDIA environment","The article analyzes how community members who were evacuated from their homes use various media, and especially the internet, to keep in touch, receive and disseminate information and express their opinions. Of particular interest are the differences between members of various groups, who differ in their decision whether to relocate in Israel with the rest of the original community or not, in media usage patterns and sense of community. The findings demonstrate that evacuees use diversity and multiplicity of media, where various media are used for different purposes according to need. Small media, with a rather limited and local reach (such as pamphlets, SMS, niche websites and small-scale meetings) are predominantly used for most of the needs, overshadowing mass media usage. Correlations were found amongst various media usages, and between the usage of various media and users sense of community. The study demonstrates how contemporary media users use a variety of media depending on their circumstances and needs, and how media usage assists in establishing and maintaining a sense of community after the forced transition from the communities of origin.",exclude,,
EXMPL8,exclude,Group profiling for understanding social structures,"The prolific use of participatory Web and social networking sites is reshaping the ways in which people interact with one another. It has become a vital part of human social life in both the developed and developing world. People sharing certain similarities or affiliates tend to form communities within social media. At the same time, they participate in various online activities: content sharing, tagging, posting status updates, etc. These diverse activities leave behind traces of their social life, providing clues to understand changing social structures. A large body of existing work focuses on extracting cohesive groups based on network topology. But little attention is paid to understanding the changing social structures. In order to help explain the formation of a group, we explore different group-profiling strategies to construct descriptions of a group. This research can assist network navigation, visualization, and analysis, as well as monitoring and tracking the ebbs and tides of different groups in evolving networks. By exploiting information collected from real-world social media sites, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate group-profiling results. The pros and cons of different group-profiling strategies are analyzed with concrete examples. We also show some potential applications based on group profiling. Interesting findings with discussions are reported.",exclude,,
EXMPL9,exclude,Review article: Reviewing the impact of virtual teams in the information age,"This paper provides an overview of virtual teams in the information age, focussing on the definition of virtual teams, their salient characteristics, the communication issues they face (including information overload, geographic and social distance), the technical issues involved (linking this to theories of media use), the issues raised by cultural diversity in the teams (including identity, trust and conflict) and managerial implications. Suggestions are made on how to address the issues raised and omissions from previous research are highlighted.",exclude,,
EXMPL10,exclude,Its just not that exciting anymore”: The changing centrality of SMS in the everyday lives of young Danes,"This article considers the centrality of short message system (SMS) texting in the communication repertoires of young Danes. Recent years have seen dramatic changes in the mediascape with a multitude of new possibilities for text-based communication; Facebook, in particular, has become popular among young Danes. Some have suggested that the role of SMS texting, a technology that was previously an entrenched part of young peoples communication repertoires, has changed in this diversified media environment. Based on interviews with 31 Danish high school students and drawing on the domestication approach, this article examines the use practices and meanings associated with SMS texting in todays complex and evolving mediascape. This article argues that SMS texting is becoming re-domesticated, its meanings changing, and the technology finding a new position in the communication repertoires of users.",exclude,,
