EXMPL1,include,"Biased Representation of Politicians in Google and Wikipedia Search? The Joint Effect of Party Identity, Gender Identity and Elections","Web search engines have become an important and trusted source when people seek political information. Even though previous research suggests that information about politicians in traditional and new media can provide content that makes stereotypes based on gender and party, little is known about the presence of such bias in search engines, which function as information gatekeepers in the digital age. Using quantitative text analysis and human coding techniques on a novel data set of members of the German parliament, this study examines whether search engine suggestions, i.e. search predictions, for politicians differ with respect to personal and role-oriented information based on the gender and party of the politician. It also explores whether the search engine representation of politicians changes around elections. The study further compares gender and party differences in search engine results with corresponding Wikipedia articles of the same politicians, as users are most often redirected to Wikipedia from Google. The results suggest that politicians representation in search engines and Wikipedia are structured by a joint effect of their gender and party identity. While Google suggestions provide less personal information about female politicians belonging to a right-wing party compared to their male counterparts, this relationship is not observable for left-wing parties. Moreover, there are changes in gender biases around the election. In Wikipedia articles, politicians belonging to right-wing parties are represented with more personal information compared to politicians belonging to left ones, an effect which is even stronger for females.",include,,
EXMPL6,exclude,Meaning Multiplicity Across Communication Subfields: Bridging the Gaps,"Subdisciplines in communication studies have developed competing and self-contained theories of meaning multiplicity. Arguing that this fragmented scholarship falls short of grasping the full scope of the phenomenon, this article offers Decoding Convergence-Divergence (DCD) as an interdisciplinary analytical and conceptual framework. Synthesizing principles from cognitive, cultural, and speaker-centered approaches to meaning multiplicity, this framework was applied in a study that examined news coverage of a CEOs initiative to address income inequality and its reception by different segments of the American audience. The studys results provide a novel demonstration of the joint contribution of opposing theories to the understanding of meaning multiplicity. Specifically, it found that textual polysemy, partisan selective perception, and the use of strategic ambiguity coalesced in the interpretive dynamics of this story. Based on these results, the article discusses the contribution of DCD to bridging competing approaches and the potential applications of the framework.",exclude,,
