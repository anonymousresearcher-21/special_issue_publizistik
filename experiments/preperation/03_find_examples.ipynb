However, the diversity and popularity of online social networks attract malicious users to inject new forms of spam. Spamming is a malicious activity where a fake user spreads unsolicited messages in the form of bulk message, fraudulent review, malware/virus, hate speech, profanity, or advertising for marketing scam. In addition, it is found that spammers usually form a connected community of spam accounts and use them to spread spam to a large set of legitimate users. Consequently, it is highly desirable to detect such spammer communities existing in social networks. Even though a significant amount of work has been done in the field of detecting spam messages and accounts, not much research has been done in detecting spammer communities and hidden spam accounts. In this work, an unsupervised approach called SpamCom is proposed for detecting spammer communities in Twitter. We model the Twitter network as a multilayer social network and exploit the existence of overlapping community-based features of users represented in the form of Hypergraphs to identify spammers based on their structural behavior and URL characteristics. The use of community-based features, graph and URL characteristics of user accounts, and content similarity among users make our technique very robust and efficient. {\\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</td>\n",

Its central focus examines the ways ESPN responds to the “browning of America” and its changing demographics. To this end, the essay examines the emergence and development of ESPN Deportes, and provides a textual analysis of “One Naci{\\'{o}}n” (September 2015-August 2016), a podcast hosted by Max Bretos (Cuban American) and Marly Rivera (Puerto Rican). Offering a textual and content analysis, I suggest that One Naci{\\'{o}}n provides a benchmark to assess the cultural politics of diversifying sport media content, coverage, and context. Moreover, I argue that One Naci{\\'{o}}n, while unable to escape the dominant features of late racial/gendered capitalism, produces a counterhegemonic discursive practice capable of challenging mediated circulations of Latino Americans. {\\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This study of American investigative reporting from 1976 to 2012 examines a random sample (N = 757) of prize contest entry materials created by journalists. This novel data source and methodology allow for analysis of the dynamics of journalistic process rather than relying on assumptions drawn from published news content. The results provide a fuller and more sophisticated explanation of how investigative journalism is related to democratic governance, including fresh insight into journalist/source relationships, story triggers, policy outcomes, and agenda-building relationships among journalists, sources, and policymakers. A model for predicting policy agenda-building in investigative journalism is proposed and tested based on attributes of the reporting process, policy results, and other actions by public officials produced by journalists' investigations. While the analysis indicates a key role for sources in the origination of investigative news stories, it also reveals a more prominent place for journalistic enterprise than previously acknowledged. At the same time, investigative stories that are initiated by tips from sources and that have a more diverse array of sources are more likely to achieve substantive policy results. Overall, the findings point to a greater degree of interdependence among investigative reporters and policymakers that challenges conceptions of journalists as passive recipients of information but also reveals the limitations of news organizations' ability to independently spark policy change. {\\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017.</td>\n",

A randomized experiment was conducted in which participants (N = 559) were assigned to view one of four reconstructed episodes of Late Night with Seth Meyers: (a) anti-Trump comedy with anti-Trump campaign ads, (b) anti-Trump comedy with nonpolitical ads, (c) nonpolitical comedy with anti-Trump ads, and (d) nonpolitical comedy with nonpolitical ads. Results suggested that both comedy and ads exert persuasive effects on image perceptions of the candidates that subsequently influence vote intention. Furthermore, effects were largely confined to those who were high in need for cognition. There was no additive benefit to pairing ads with political comedy. The results are discussed regarding their contribution to theories of persuasion and information processing when applied to political comedy and political ads. {\\textcopyright} 2018, {\\textcopyright} 2018 Mass Communication {\\&amp;} Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.</td>\n",

Despite their work being tarred as biased, soft or preaching to the converted, Indigenous media producers argue that their work counterbalances biased mainstream media coverage that hampers Indigenous public sphere participation and denigrates Indigenous communities and individuals. Through interviews with 42 Indigenous media producers from Australia, Canada, Finland, Sweden and New Zealand, this study investigates their journalistic processes and attitudes to professional norms such as objectivity, source choices and news values. The article interrogates how Indigenous media producers navigate the tensions between their professional obligations and community responsibilities. It argues Indigenous media producers apply a modified version of objectivity to produce fact-driven content that promotes Indigenous perspectives, prioritizes Indigenous voices and serves the needs of their communities. {\\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018.</td>\n",

       "0                 Online social networks have become immensely popular in recent years and have become the major sources for tracking the reverberation of events and news throughout the world. However, the diversity and popularity of online social networks attract malicious users to inject new forms of spam. Spamming is a malicious activity where a fake user spreads unsolicited messages in the form of bulk message, fraudulent review, malware/virus, hate speech, profanity, or advertising for marketing scam. In addition, it is found that spammers usually form a connected community of spam accounts and use them to spread spam to a large set of legitimate users. Consequently, it is highly desirable to detect such spammer communities existing in social networks. Even though a significant amount of work has been done in the field of detecting spam messages and accounts, not much research has been done in detecting spammer communities and hidden spam accounts. In this work, an unsupervised approach called SpamCom is proposed for detecting spammer communities in Twitter. We model the Twitter network as a multilayer social network and exploit the existence of overlapping community-based features of users represented in the form of Hypergraphs to identify spammers based on their structural behavior and URL characteristics. The use of community-based features, graph and URL characteristics of user accounts, and content similarity among users make our technique very robust and efficient. {\\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.   \n",

Its central focus examines the ways ESPN responds to the “browning of America” and its changing demographics. To this end, the essay examines the emergence and development of ESPN Deportes, and provides a textual analysis of “One Naci{\\'{o}}n” (September 2015-August 2016), a podcast hosted by Max Bretos (Cuban American) and Marly Rivera (Puerto Rican). Offering a textual and content analysis, I suggest that One Naci{\\'{o}}n provides a benchmark to assess the cultural politics of diversifying sport media content, coverage, and context. Moreover, I argue that One Naci{\\'{o}}n, while unable to escape the dominant features of late racial/gendered capitalism, produces a counterhegemonic discursive practice capable of challenging mediated circulations of Latino Americans. {\\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018.   \n",
       "2  This study of American investigative reporting from 1976 to 2012 examines a random sample (N = 757) of prize contest entry materials created by journalists. This novel data source and methodology allow for analysis of the dynamics of journalistic process rather than relying on assumptions drawn from published news content. The results provide a fuller and more sophisticated explanation of how investigative journalism is related to democratic governance, including fresh insight into journalist/source relationships, story triggers, policy outcomes, and agenda-building relationships among journalists, sources, and policymakers. A model for predicting policy agenda-building in investigative journalism is proposed and tested based on attributes of the reporting process, policy results, and other actions by public officials produced by journalists' investigations. While the analysis indicates a key role for sources in the origination of investigative news stories, it also reveals a more prominent place for journalistic enterprise than previously acknowledged. At the same time, investigative stories that are initiated by tips from sources and that have a more diverse array of sources are more likely to achieve substantive policy results. Overall, the findings point to a greater degree of interdependence among investigative reporters and policymakers that challenges conceptions of journalists as passive recipients of information but also reveals the limitations of news organizations' ability to independently spark policy change. {\\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017.   \n",

A randomized experiment was conducted in which participants (N = 559) were assigned to view one of four reconstructed episodes of Late Night with Seth Meyers: (a) anti-Trump comedy with anti-Trump campaign ads, (b) anti-Trump comedy with nonpolitical ads, (c) nonpolitical comedy with anti-Trump ads, and (d) nonpolitical comedy with nonpolitical ads. Results suggested that both comedy and ads exert persuasive effects on image perceptions of the candidates that subsequently influence vote intention. Furthermore, effects were largely confined to those who were high in need for cognition. There was no additive benefit to pairing ads with political comedy. The results are discussed regarding their contribution to theories of persuasion and information processing when applied to political comedy and political ads. {\\textcopyright} 2018, {\\textcopyright} 2018 Mass Communication {\\&} Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.   \n",

Despite their work being tarred as biased, soft or preaching to the converted, Indigenous media producers argue that their work counterbalances biased mainstream media coverage that hampers Indigenous public sphere participation and denigrates Indigenous communities and individuals. Through interviews with 42 Indigenous media producers from Australia, Canada, Finland, Sweden and New Zealand, this study investigates their journalistic processes and attitudes to professional norms such as objectivity, source choices and news values. The article interrogates how Indigenous media producers navigate the tensions between their professional obligations and community responsibilities. It argues Indigenous media producers apply a modified version of objectivity to produce fact-driven content that promotes Indigenous perspectives, prioritizes Indigenous voices and serves the needs of their communities. {\\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018.   \n",
