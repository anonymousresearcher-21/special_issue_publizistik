1,{Online MEDIA within the public service realm?: Reasons to include online into the public service mission},"Public service media are no longer limited to radio and television as new media genres emerge. Among others, the online medium has supplemented radio, television and the press since the mid-1990s and has become a medium in its own right. Moreover, online media have become essential elements of media consumption patterns. Public service media compete not only with private radio and television broadcasters but also with the press. The question arises, whether such competition in the online field results in more diversity and higher output quality, serving the public interest better. In Europe, there are at least two different schools of thought. One line of argument accepts the public service expansion into online media and regards online media as a necessary and important field for public service activities. Another line of argument suggests limiting the public service remit strictly to radio and broadcasting and considers online media as an emerging market subject to competition among private companies only. Based on the results of a comparative empirical analysis of online media provided by public service broadcasters and print publishers in Switzerland, Germany and Austria (from 2006) this article shows that the achieved results in media output are disappointing. Only few online media live up to the expectations. The article finally argues that the extension of the public service remit to online media might enhance quality and diversity.

**Reasoning:** 

The abstract meets several of the inclusion criteria, making it relevant to the systematic literature review on media diversity in political communication:

- **IC1 (Empirical or theoretical research):** The abstract indicates that the article is based on a ""comparative empirical analysis"" of online media provided by public service broadcasters and print publishers in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. This satisfies the requirement for empirical research.

- **IC2 (Media content or market analysis):** The abstract discusses the role of online media within the public service realm and its competition with private broadcasters and the press. This involves an analysis of media content and market dynamics, aligning with the criteria.

- **IC3 (Diversity analysis in media):** The abstract explicitly raises the question of whether competition in the online field results in more diversity and higher output quality, which directly addresses media diversity. It also argues that extending the public service remit to online media might enhance quality and diversity, indicating a focus on diversity analysis.

The abstract does not meet any of the exclusion criteria:

- **EC1 (Non-peer-reviewed content):** The abstract is published by Sage Publications, suggesting it is peer-reviewed.
- **EC2 (No media content/market focus):** The focus is clearly on media content and market.
- **EC3 (Media as context only):** Media is central to the analysis.
- **EC4 (Fictional media content):** The focus is on non-fictional media.
- **EC5 (No diversity focus):** There is a clear focus on diversity.
- **EC6 (Non-media diversity focus):** The diversity focus is on media.
- **EC7 (Peripheral diversity mention):** Diversity is a primary focus.
- **EC8 (Superficial diversity reference):** The discussion on diversity is substantive.

Overall, the abstract aligns well with the inclusion criteria, particularly in its focus on media diversity and empirical analysis, warranting a relevance score of 4.

2,{Observing SERENDIPity in digital information environments},"We often interact with digital information environments to find useful information. But sometimes useful information finds us unexpectedly, propelling us in new and exciting directions. We might come across information serendipitously when looking for information on something else, or when we are not looking for anything in particular. In previous studies, people have self-reported that they come across information serendipitously. However, there has been limited success in directly observing people doing so. To see if we could have more success, we conducted naturalistic observations of 45 users interacting with different types of digital information environments. Without priming them about serendipity, we asked the users to conduct self-chosen naturalistic information tasks, which varied from broad tasks such as browsing online news to narrow tasks such as finding a particular product to buy. We noted several examples where users either 1) stated they were looking for information on a particular topic or product and unexpectedly found useful/potentially useful information about something else or 2) unexpectedly found useful/potentially useful information when not looking for anything in particular. Our findings suggest that, with a carefully-considered approach, serendipity-related information interaction behaviour can be directly observed. Direct observation allows designers of digital information environments to better understand this behaviour and use this understanding to reason about ways of designing new or improving existing support for serendipity.

3,{Actor DIVERSity and viewpoint DIVERSity: Two of a kind?},"News content diversity is generally considered to be an essential
precondition for the promotion of social pluralism. However, how
diversity of news content should be conceptualized and measured is less
clear. We use a content analysis of newspaper articles about immigration
(2013-14) in Belgium (Flanders) to measure the diversity of actors and
viewpoints in the news, and to study the link between those two
subdimensions of content diversity. We find that the representation of a
plurality of active actors in a news article seems to go hand in hand
with a more diverse range of viewpoints. The findings show that there
are no significant differences in the level of actor and viewpoint
diversity between quality and popular newspapers. However, the length of
the article has a positive effect on providing more diversity. Moreover,
our results indicate that allowing for individual immigrants to talk in
the reporting is fundamental to promoting a more positive representation
of immigration in the news.",True,True,1,1,5,5,1,1,"**Relevance Score:** 5

4,"{FILTER BUBBLEs, ECHO CHAMBERs, and online NEWS consumption}","Online publishing, social networks, and web search have dramatically
lowered the costs of producing, distributing, and discovering news
articles. Some scholars argue that such technological changes increase
exposure to diverse perspectives, while others worry that they increase
ideological segregation. We address the issue by examining web-browsing
histories for 50,000 US-located users who regularly read online news. We
find that social networks and search engines are associated with an
increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals. However,
somewhat counterintuitively, these same channels also are associated
with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from his or her
less preferred side of the political spectrum. Finally, the vast
majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals
simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream,
news outlets, tempering the consequences-both positive and negative-of

5,{Democracy and the press: A comparative analysis of PLURALism in the international print MEDIA},"The relationship between democracy and press pluralism is assessed in seven countries: China, Colombia, Egypt, Germany, India, Lithuania, and Russia. The term ""pluralism"" is defined as the extent to which diverse and competing views appear in the content of the mainstream press on a given news topic. Content analysis of 2,172 articles from the 10 largest newspapers in each country, published in the first months after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, is used to evaluate the level of press pluralism. The main indicator of democracy is based on data from the Freedom House organization, though other democracy indexes are considered. Previous studies have offered conflicting views on the relationship between democracy and press pluralism. Although this study finds mixed results, the general tendency, which is based on 10 major news issues surrounding the events of 9/11, supports the perspective that democracy is not always positively associated with press pluralism. Much of the debate over 9/11 in countries ranked as highly democratic was less pluralistic than in countries with weaker democratic institutions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

6,{Sports organizations in a new wave of MEDIAtization},"This article explores the transforming effects of digital media in
sports organizations. The approach to this is an analytical focus on a
wide range of sports, which are examined from an institutional and
organizational approach to mediatization theory. On the basis of an
empirical study of governing sports organizations (national sports
federations), it is demonstrated that digital media are a major concern
across organizations and that a new wave of mediatization is taking
place in sports. Still, many organizations struggle with this and
currently find themselves in a state of flux, trying to involve
employees, volunteers, and external partners with communication
competencies in their activities in various ways, on many levels, and
for many varying purposes. Consequently, one of the significant effects
of digital media is a dispersion of communication involving more people
and concurrent increase in internal complexity in many organizations.
Mediatization is therefore a process that is very much in operation at
many levels and at various speeds, but it also takes organizations in
diverse directions. Using Thornton and Ocasio's interinstitutional
approach and concept of institutional logics, it is argued and
demonstrated that this is because these sports organizations have other
relevant and powerful institutional partners or organizations that need
to be considered in the process as well.",False,False,0,0,1,1,0,0,"**Relevance Score:** 1

7,{For everything a season? A month-by-month analysis of SOCIAL NETWORK resources in later life},"It is widely acknowledged that informal social ties provide older persons with many resources that serve to protect and improve their levels of health and well-being. Most studies on this topic, however, ignore the month or season of the year during which data was accumulated. This study proposes two hypotheses to explain seniors' social network resources over the calendar year: the “fluctuation hypothesis”, which proposes that seasonal variation, in the form of weather fluctuations, institutional calendars, and holidays, might influence the social lives and resources of older persons, and the “network stability” perspective, which, informed by tenets of convoy theory and socioemotional selectivity theory, emphasizes the increasing importance of close network ties as individuals age and the stability of these ties. Using two waves (2005–2006 and 2010–2011) of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older adults aged 57–85 in the United States, we examine a diverse set of nine social connectedness outcomes. Results, overall, support the network stability perspective, as the only social connectedness outcome found to significantly vary by month of year was average closeness with network members. We conclude by suggesting some methodological considerations for survey research and by noting how these findings complement the growing literature on inter-year fluctuation in social networks and social support. Changes in older adults' networks, while frequently observable over the course of years, do not seem to be seasonally patterned. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc.",False,False,0,0,1,1,0,0,"**Relevance Score:** 1

11,{Communication and Exchange of Specialized Health-Related Support Among People With Experiential Similarity on FACEBOOK},"Social support is an important factor that shapes how people cope with illness, and health-related communication among peers managing the same illness (network ties with experiential similarity) offers specialized information, resources, and emotional support. Facebook has become a ubiquitous part of many Americans' lives, and may offer a way for patients and caregivers experiencing a similar illness to exchange specialized health-related support. However, little is known about the content of communication among people who have coped with the same illness on personal Facebook pages. We conducted a content analysis of 12 months of data from 18 publicly available Facebook pages hosted by parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, focusing on communication between users who self-identified as parents of pediatric cancer patients. Support exchanges between users with experiential similarity contained highly specialized health-related information, including information about health services use, symptom recognition, compliance, medication use, treatment protocols, and medical procedures. Parents also exchanged tailored emotional support through comparison, empathy, encouragement, and hope. Building upon previous research documenting that social media use can widen and diversify support networks, our findings show that cancer caregivers access specialized health-related informational and emotional support through communication with others who have experienced the same illness on personal Facebook pages. These findings have implications for health communication practice and offer evidence to tailor M-Health interventions that leverage existing social media platforms to enhance peer support for patients and caregivers. {\textcopyright} 2017 Taylor {\&} Francis.",False,False,0,0,1,1,0,0,"**Relevance Score:** 1

13,{Towards DIVERSity in young adult fiction: Australian YA authors' publishing experiences and its implications for YA librarians and readers' advisory services},"Based on a study of Australian young adult (YA) fiction authors, this paper argues that it is necessary for publishers, booksellers, and YA librarians to pay attention to the global movement towards diversity: diversity within their own organisations, diversity among authors they publish, stock, or collect, and representations of diversity within YA fiction. The mainstream attention to diversity has particularly focused on media for young people, with advocates stating that children and teenagers from traditionally marginalised communities deserve to see their own experiences reflected and validated in the media they consume. This paper looks at diversity in writing and traditional publishing through interviews with Australian YA authors (conducted in 2016) from traditionally marginalised or unacknowledged communities, especially as it relates to their transition from reader to writer, and their experience of the publishing journey. A critical discourse analysis of the interviews point to a need for more diversity representations in YA fiction, and also the need for a change in industry practices to enable this, including publishing, bookselling, and library practices.

14,{Reinventing the heights: the origins of rockclimbing culture in Australia},"Australian rockclimbing culture and climbers have been imagined in a
particular way with the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century
press playing a key role. Australian landscapes, including mountains,
were incorporated into Indigenous cosmology for millennia before
Aboriginal people discovered Europeans. But with the colonial invasion,
the very nature of the landscape in the new colony meant that climbing
culture was bound to take on a different persona from its European
antecedent and undergo a rethinking or reinvention process. Figuring
strongly in this discursive reconstruction was the particular geography
of one region in Australia - southeast Queensland - with its diverse
collection of volcanic peaks within range of a major population centre,
along with a climate that encouraged the emergence of a set of
complementary leisure activities. This article explores the emergence of
rockclimbing culture in Australia from a range of often competing and
contradictory discourses - Aboriginal cosmology, a unique landscape, the
influence of the European idea of climbing and charismatic, visionary
individuals. From the turn of the twentieth century, the role of local
newspapers and magazines was a crucial element in this imagining process
creating briefly a space for female climbers that has only recently been
reclaimed. From the late 1880s, and particularly during the 1920s and
1930s, press reports of climbing and associated activities offered new
ways of conceptualizing mountains and their place in shaping Australian
culture.",False,False,0,0,1,1,0,0,"**Relevance Score:** 1

15,{SCENT: Scalable Compressed Monitoring of Evolving Multirelational SOCIAL NETWORKs},"We propose SCENT, an innovative, scalable spectral analysis framework
for internet scale monitoring of multirelational social media data,
encoded in the form of tensor streams. In particular, a significant
challenge is to detect key changes in the social media data, which could
reflect important events in the real world, sufficiently quickly. Social
media data have three challenging characteristics. First, data sizes are
enormous; recent technological advances allow hundreds of millions of
users to create and share content within online social networks. Second,
social data are often multifaceted (i.e., have many dimensions of
potential interest, from the textual content to user metadata). Finally,
the data is dynamic; structural changes can occur at multiple time
scales and be localized to a subset of users. Consequently, a framework
for extracting useful information from social media data needs to scale
with data volume, and also with the number and diversity of the facets
of the data. In SCENT, we focus on the computational cost of structural
change detection in tensor streams. We extend compressed sensing (CS) to
tensor data. We show that, through the use of randomized tensor
ensembles, SCENT is able to encode the observed tensor streams in the
form of compact descriptors. We show that the descriptors allow very
fast detection of significant spectral changes in the tensor stream,
which also reduce data collection, storage, and processing costs.
Experiments over synthetic and real data show that SCENT is faster

16,{Understanding NEWS sharing in SOCIAL MEDIA: An explanation from the diffusion of innovations theory},"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to draw from the diffusion of innovations theory to explore multi-levels of influences (i.e. individuals, networks, news attributes) on news sharing in social media. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was designed and administered to 309 respondents. Structural equation modelling analysis was conducted to examine the three levels of influential factors. These included self-perceptions of opinion leadership and seeking at the individual level, perceived tie strength and homophily at the network level, and finally, perceived news credibility and news preference at the news attribute level. Findings: The results revealed that the influences of self-perceptions of opinion leadership, perceived tie strength in online networks and perceived preference of online news had significant effects on users' news sharing intention in social media. However, self-perceptions of opinion seeking, homophily, and perceived news credibility were not significant. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies on news sharing in social media that focus on diverse levels of influential factors.

17,{Reviewing person's value of privacy of online SOCIAL NETWORKing},"Purpose - The paper aims at a multi-faceted review of scholarly work,
analyzing the current state of empirical studies dealing with privacy
and online social networking (OSN) as well as the theoretical
``puzzle{\{}''{\}} of privacy approaches related to OSN usage from the
background of diverse disciplines. Drawing on a more pragmatic and
practical level, aspects of privacy management are presented as well.
Design/methodology/approach - Based on individual privacy concerns and
also publicly communicated threats, information privacy has become an
important topic of public and scholarly discussion. Beside diverse
positive aspects of OSN sites for users, their information is for
example also being used for data mining and profiling, pre-recruiting
information as well as economic espionage. This review highlights
information privacy mainly from an individual point-of-view, focusing on
the usage of OSN sites (OSNs).
Findings - This analysis of scholarly work shows the following findings:
first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats
than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large
part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on
OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional
one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short. Hence, findings of this
paper further highlight the necessity to focus on multidimensional and
multidisciplinary frameworks of privacy, for example considering a
so-called ``privacy calculus paradigm{\{}''{\}} and rethinking ``fair
information practices{\{}''{\}} from a more and more ubiquitous environment of

18,{The 'urban age' in question},"Foreboding declarations about contemporary urban trends pervade early twenty-first century academic, political and journalistic discourse. Among the most widely recited is the claim that we now live in an 'urban age' because, for the first time in human history, more than half the world's population today purportedly lives within cities. Across otherwise diverse discursive, ideological and locational contexts, the urban age thesis has become a form of doxic common sense around which questions regarding the contemporary global urban condition are framed. This article argues that, despite its long history and its increasingly widespread influence, the urban age thesis is a flawed basis on which to conceptualize world urbanization patterns: it is empirically untenable (a statistical artifact) and theoretically incoherent (a chaotic conception). This critique is framed against the background of postwar attempts to measure the world's urban population, the main methodological and theoretical conundrums of which remain fundamentally unresolved in early twenty-first century urban age discourse.

Although research demonstrates the benefits of online learning for student success, instructors face challenges in facilitating communication, delivering course content, and navigating outdated and cumbersome technologies.

The authors present a case study of Slack's use in an online second-year environmental politics course taught at a large Canadian public university. There is a significant and growing literature on how to best engage students in online learning, including active and social learning models as promising approaches to digital teaching.

20,{User-centered Design of Business Communities. The Influence of DIVERSity Factors on Motives to use Communities in Professional Settings},"The professional use and implementation of social media or social media related applications are booming. Solutions like business internal communities promise to connect employees in a more flexible way than old-fashioned mailing lists or static network drives ever could. New solutions are perceived to support communication independent from time and space and in allow a more flexible way of communicating direct as well as indirect through the offer of different communication media (chat, voice over IP, mail, blog, etc.). But in contrast to remarkably good application scenarios, reality is not keeping up. Therefore more investigations of usage conditions and acceptance parameters are needed to find out which showstoppers interfere with a successful implementation. Due to the fact that acceptance by future users is one core condition for a successful implementation of software within operational structures and processes, this paper presents a study with focus on motivational issues to use business communities depending on diversity factors. In this study the focus is set on the diversity factors age, gender, social media expertise, achievement motivation, and perceived locus of control over technology (ploc). First results revealed that the classical user diversity variables age and gender do not influence the motives to use business communities. In contrast technology related diversity factors and achievement motivation revealed correlations with usage motives (r {\textgreater}. 3). The most important motives were the need for information and autonomy. Achievement motivation showed the strongest correlation with the need for social interaction (r =. 51), indicating that highly motivated people can be motivated to use a SNS if it facilitates social interaction. {\textcopyright} 2015",False,False,0,0,1,1,0,0,"**Relevance Score:** 1

In contrast process engineers in a diverse range of manufacturing environments regularly deploy business improvement techniques, such as the six-sigma methodology. Such techniques aim to control and subsequently identify the relationship between the process inputs and outputs so that a process engineer can more accurately predict how the process output shall perform based on the system inputs. Factors such as cost reduction, automatic process control or simply process prediction may be the defining factors in establishing prediction models. In this paper the authors use as a case study the manufacture of hard disc drives, from the developing of the read-write head to the recording media and the overall construction of the hard disc drive with its controlling mechanisms. Each of these stages are separate and complex-processing elements and integral to the functionality of the end product. In addition each of these stages of manufacturing may take days or weeks to complete and be processed in separate facilities and/or countries.

The application is guided by a six-sigma methodology to obtain improved performance.

22,{Where are the borders of MEDIA capitalism in Slovenia?},"The development in the Slovenian media market suggests that media
legislation that is dominated by a free market ideology does not prevent
the concentration of media capital. The process of media privatisation
takes different courses in print media and in broadcasting. The main
problems relate to (1)the non-transparency of privatisation processes,
(2) media as family business, (3) cross-media ownership, (4) the
impairment of public capital, (5) hostile take-overs. The authors
analyse five forms of media ownership concentration in Slovenia: (1)
chains - the same company owns more than the ``normal{\{}''{\}} number of
media of the same kind in the state; (2) networks - a holding company
produces programs and distributes them with the help of local stations
that are members of its network, but have their own legal independence;
(3) cross-media ownership - media companies include different kinds of
media in their portfolio; (4) conglomerates - corporations whose main
activity pertains to a different branch of the economy acquire a media
company; (5) vertical integration - mergers in programming production,
distribution, publishing activities, etc. Experiences with the
``deregulation{\{}''{\}} demonstrate that just an increase of the number of
available channels or the expansion of new print media does not
automatically increase the diversity of contents and sources.",False,False,0,0,5,5,1,1,"**Relevance Score:** 5

**Reasoning:** 

The abstract for ""Where are the borders of MEDIA capitalism in Slovenia?"" is highly relevant to the systematic literature review on media diversity in political communication based on the following criteria:

- **IC1 (Empirical or theoretical research):** The abstract indicates an analysis of media ownership concentration, which suggests empirical research into the media market structure in Slovenia. This aligns with the inclusion criterion for empirical or theoretical research.

- **IC2 (Media content or market analysis):** The abstract explicitly discusses the Slovenian media market, focusing on media legislation, privatisation, and ownership concentration. This is a direct analysis of the media market, meeting the criterion.

- **IC3 (Diversity analysis in media):** The abstract addresses the issue of media ownership concentration and its impact on diversity, specifically mentioning that an increase in the number of channels or print media does not automatically increase diversity of contents and sources. This directly relates to media diversity analysis, fulfilling this criterion.

- **EC1 (Non-peer-reviewed content):** There is no indication that the content is non-peer-reviewed, so this exclusion criterion does not apply.

- **EC2 (No media content/market focus):** The focus is clearly on the media market, so this exclusion criterion does not apply.

- **EC3 (Media as context only):** Media is central to the analysis, not just a context, so this exclusion criterion does not apply.

- **EC4 (Fictional media content):** The abstract does not focus on fictional media content, so this exclusion criterion does not apply.

23,{Real and Perceived Attitude Agreement in SOCIAL NETWORKs},"It is often asserted that friends and acquaintances have more similar
beliefs and attitudes than do strangers; yet empirical studies disagree
over exactly how much diversity of opinion exists within local social

conducted on the Facebook social networking platform, in which
participants were asked about their own political attitudes, as well as
their beliefs about their friends' attitudes. Although considerable
attitude similarity exists among friends, the results show that friends
disagree more than they think they do. In particular, friends are
typically unaware of their disagreements, even when they say they
discuss the topic, suggesting that discussion is not the primary means
by which friends infer each other's views on particular issues. Rather,
it appears that respondents infer opinions in part by relying on
stereotypes of their friends and in part by projecting their own views.

24,{Typology of Web 2.0 spheres: Understanding the cultural dimensions of SOCIAL MEDIA spaces},"It has taken the past decade to commonly acknowledge that online space is tethered to real place. From euphoric conceptualizations of social media spaces as a novel, unprecedented and revolutionary entity, the dust has settled, allowing for talk of boundaries and ties to real-world settings. Metaphors have been instrumental in this pursuit, shaping perceptions and affecting actions within this extended structural realm. Specifically, they have been harnessed to architect Web 2.0 spaces, be it chatrooms, electronic frontiers, homepages, or information highways for policy and practice. While metaphors are pervasive in addressing and normalizing new media spaces, there is less effort channeled into organizing these digital domains along cultural lines to systematize and deepen understandings of its histories, agencies and communities. Hence, this article proposes a framework that reveals dominant cultural dimensions of Web 2.0 spaces through a five-fold typology: (1) utilitarian-driven, (2) aesthetic-driven, (3) context-driven, (4) play-driven and (5) value-driven. This effort capitalizes and transfers mappings of actors and networks from real to virtual space to capture and organize diverse cultural (re)productions. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.",False,False,0,0,1,1,0,0,"**Relevance Score:** 1

The results showed that editorials in communities that were more structurally or ethnically pluralistic and less politically or religiously conservative were more likely to support granting citizenship to illegal immigrants. The more structurally or ethnically pluralistic the community, the more likely its editorials perceived illegal immigrants as “beneficial” to the country. The more religiously or politically conservative the community, the more likely its editorials perceived illegal immigrants as “harmful.” [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR], Copyright of Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly is the property of Sage Publications Inc. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright hold)",True,False,1,0,3,3,1,0,"**Relevance Score:** 3

SMIS engages central figures in online social networks to help recruit participants among visitors to these websites, yielding sizable samples for experimental research. We present data from six samples collected using the SMIS method and compare them to those gathered by other sampling approaches such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk. While not representative of the general adult population, our SMIS samples are significantly more diverse than undergraduate convenience samples, not only demographically but also politically. We discuss the applicability of the method to experimental research and its usefulness for obtaining samples of special, politically relevant subpopulations such as political sophisticates and activists. We argue that the diversity of SMIS samples, along with the ability to capture highly engaged citizens, can circumvent questions about the artificiality of political behavior experiments entirely based on student samples and help to document sources of heterogeneous experimental treatment effects. {\textcopyright} American Political Science Association 2013.",False,False,0,0,2,2,0,0,"**Relevance Score:** 2

This article examines one such case, that is, Getty's Genderblend visual trend, which claims to portray gender identities and relations in ways that are both more inclusive and diverse, harnessing feminist theory as part of its promotion. Taking a multimodal discourse and visual design approach, the article looks at how corporate imagery can be styled as political and, in turn, how a politics of difference itself is shaped in the interests of the ideologies of consumer capitalism.

The analysis provides insights into the (in)visibility of the LGBT community over a period of significant social change. It finds that although the number of explicit representations of LGBT characters has risen dramatically, 230 out of 240 intersections of sexuality, class, age, and race remain invisible. In using a new ad format—human interest ads—advertisers move away from hypersexualization, toward real individuals' stories of love and families. Nonetheless, the analysis highlights how the erasure of multiply marginalized groups in mainstream advertising continues to perpetuate a heteronormative, domesticized version of “gayness” and discusses the adverse effects that lie herein.

new categories of consumers - not only the much-vaunted `middle class'.
Yet, for all the exceptional rates of growth in advertising expenditure
being recorded, and the breathless rhetoric of the trade press, the
impact the global advertisers and their agencies have upon Asia needs to
be put into perspective. For instance, although the use of the internet
and other new media is rapidly gaining ground, television still
dominates, because that is the medium favoured by the biggest-spending
advertisers in these countries. Ultimately, Asia is defined more by its

more collaborative. As a result, collaboration with the right
individuals, teams, and institutions is increasingly crucial for
scientific progress. We propose Research Networking Systems (RNS) as a
new type of system designed to help scientists identify and choose
collaborators, and suggest a corresponding research agenda. The research
agenda covers four areas: foundations, presentation, architecture, and
evaluation. Foundations includes project-, institution- and
discipline-specific motivational factors; the role of social networks;
and impression formation based on information beyond expertise and
interests. Presentation addresses representing expertise in a
comprehensive and up-to-date manner; the role of controlled vocabularies
and folksonomies; the tension between seekers' need for comprehensive
information and potential collaborators' desire to control how they are
seen by others; and the need to support serendipitous discovery of
collaborative opportunities. Architecture considers aggregation and
synthesis of information from multiple sources, social system
interoperability, and integration with the user's primary work context.
Lastly, evaluation focuses on assessment of collaboration decisions,
measurement of user-specific costs and benefits, and how the large-scale
impact of RNS could be evaluated with longitudinal and naturalistic
methods. We hope that this article stimulates the human-computer

45,{The Autobiography of Intercultural Encounters through Visual MEDIA: exploring images of others in telecollaboration},"Positioned against the background of the Council of Europe's interest in developing intercultural competence through education, the study presented in this paper investigates the impact on intercultural visual literacy of the Council of Europe's Images of Others – An Autobiography of Intercultural Encounters through Visual Media (AIEVM). In our study, the AIEVM was used within the context of an online intercultural exchange between pre-service language teachers. Findings indicate increased intercultural awareness as students at universities in Germany and Spain engaged with the visually ‘mediated other' through working systematically with the AIEVM. Multiperspectivity and critical cultural awareness in particular were shown to be enhanced through discussing ‘images of others' in culturally diverse tandem teams. {\textcopyright} 2014, Taylor {\&} Francis.",False,False,0,0,1,1,0,0,"**Relevance Score:** 1

**Reasoning:** 

The abstract does not meet the inclusion criteria for the following reasons:

- **IC1 (Empirical or theoretical research):** While the study appears to be empirical, it does not focus on media diversity in political communication, which is the central theme of the review.

- **IC2 (Media content or market analysis):** The abstract discusses visual media in the context of intercultural education, not media content or market analysis related to political communication.

- **IC3 (Diversity analysis in media):** The focus is on intercultural competence and visual literacy, not on diversity analysis in media as defined by the key terms such as filter bubbles, echo chambers, or media market diversity.

The abstract meets several exclusion criteria:

- **EC2 (No media content/market focus):** The study uses media as a tool for intercultural education rather than analyzing media content or markets.

- **EC3 (Media as context only):** Media is used as a context for intercultural exchange rather than being the central focus of analysis.

- **EC5 (No diversity focus):** The study focuses on intercultural awareness and competence, not on media diversity.

- **EC6 (Non-media diversity focus):** The diversity focus is on intercultural competence, not on media diversity.

The author finds there were three competing representations of Mapuche women, which reproduce assumptions not just about them but about the people as a whole. Together, they accentuate, and simultaneously complicate, dichotomous views of Indians and women. These media portrayals are significant because they reflect and reinforce the central principles of neoliberal multiculturalismthe prevailing form of governance in contemporary Latin Americawhich promotes diversity while perpetuating the marginalization of indigenous peoples and many of their rights.

49,{The democratic deficit and European Union communication policy: An evaluation of the commission's approach to broadcasting},"The article evaluates European Union broadcasting policy in the context of the democratic deficit. It argues that it is essential to understand the democratic deficit in terms of communicative action, but this entails the question of media policy and specifically broadcasting, as one of the dominant mediums in which citizens participate in public life. In outlining the basic nature of the European Commission's approach to broadcasting, the work employs the concepts of internal and external pluralism heuristically. Applying these two categories to the Commission's decisions on State aid and competition policy, in order to assess how European Union media policy hangs together to form a comprehensive approach to media regulation. It challenges what has become the orthodoxy in reviews of European audio-visual policy and argues that the Commission has adopted a mature sense of the importance of broadcasting in the democratic process. At the same time however, the idea that the democratic deficit can be fruitfully approached through broadcasting initiatives is undermined due to the restricted access the Commis-sion has to the broadcasting sector in the regulatory sphere, where the Member States retain power.",False,False,0,0,4,4,1,1,"**Relevance Score:** 4

- **IC3 (Diversity analysis in media):** The abstract mentions the concepts of ""internal and external pluralism,"" which are key terms related to diversity analysis in media. This suggests a focus on diversity within the context of media policy.

The abstract does not meet any of the exclusion criteria:

- **EC1 (Non-peer-reviewed content):** There is no indication that the content is non-peer-reviewed.

- **EC2 (No media content/market focus):** The focus is clearly on media policy and broadcasting.

- **EC3 (Media as context only):** Media is central to the analysis, not just a context.

- **EC4 (Fictional media content):** The focus is on broadcasting policy, not fictional content.
