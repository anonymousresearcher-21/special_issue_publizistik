1,Still 'fire in the (full) belly'? Anti-establishment rhetoric before and after government participation,"Scholars argued that anti-establishment parties use a populist rhetoric that appeals to the worst instincts of people. Indeed, populist politicians are often viewed as charismatic leaders that have fire in their belly. While in the past these parties heavily relied on anti-establishment platforms and communication rhetoric, their increasing electoral success along with the growing duties linked with government membership transform them into more established parties, rather than pure outsiders, and cast doubts on the feasibility of keeping a populist rhetoric. This paper compares right-wing and non-right-wing populism, investigating whether populist leaders change their rhetorical strategy once in office, decreasing the level of negativity and adopting a more forward-looking and inclusive style of communication, with a stronger focus on fulfilling the policy proposal made during the electoral campaign rather than blaming political rivals. For this purpose, we collected a new corpus of political speeches extracted from video messages posted on Facebook by four anti-establishment party leaders in three countries (Austria, Italy and Spain), from 2016 to 2018, i.e., immediately before and immediately after their access to power. Overall, 30 h of recorded audio from 215 videos (amounting to around 140 million visualizations) have been analyzed using topic models and well-established semantic psycholinguistic dictionaries. The results highlight slight changes in the rhetoric of populist leaders once in power, mostly for non-right-wing populists, as their language becomes less negative, less assertive and more focused on government duties.

2,Who Represents the Constituency? Online Political Communication by Members of Parliament in the German Mixed-Member Electoral System,"Members of parliament (MPs) are elected via two different tiers in mixed-member electoral systems-as winners of a seat in a constituency or as party candidates under proportional rules. While previous research has identified important consequences of this 'mandate divide' in parliaments, questions remain how this institutional setup affects MPs' political behavior in other arenas. Analyzing more than one million social media posts, this article investigates regional representation in the online communication of German MPs. The results show that MPs elected under a direct mandate refer approximately twice as often to their constituencies by using regionalized wording and geographic references than MPs elected under the proportional tier. The substantive findings provide new evidence for the benefits of mixed-member electoral systems for political representation while the methodological approach demonstrates the added value of social media data for analyzing the political behavior of elites.

4,What?s the Tone? Easy Doesn?t Do It: Analyzing Performance and Agreement Between Off-the-Shelf Sentiment Analysis Tools,"This article scrutinizes the method of automated content analysis to measure the tone of news coverage. We compare a range of off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools to manually coded economic news as well as examine the agreement between these dictionary approaches themselves. We assess the performance of five off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools and two tailor-made dictionary-based approaches. The analyses result in five conclusions. First, there is little overlap between the off-the-shelf tools; causing wide divergence in terms of tone measurement. Second, there is no stronger overlap with manual coding for short texts (i.e., headlines) than for long texts (i.e., full articles). Third, an approach that combines individual dictionaries achieves a comparably good performance.?Fourth, precision may increase to acceptable levels at higher levels of granularity. Fifth, performance of dictionary approaches depends more on the number of relevant keywords in the dictionary than on the number of valenced words as such; a small tailor-made lexicon was not inferior to large established dictionaries. Altogether, we conclude that off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools are mostly unreliable and unsuitable for research purposes ? at least in the context of Dutch economic news ? and manual validation for the specific language, domain, and genre of the research project at hand is always warranted.

5,The Automatic Analysis of Emotion in Political Speech Based on Transcripts,"Automatic sentiment analysis is used extensively in political science. The digitization of legislative transcripts has increased the potential application of established tools for the automated analyses of emotion in text. Unlike in writing, however, expressing emotion in speech involves intonation, facial expressions, and body lan- guage. Drawing on a new dataset of annotated texts and videos from the Canadian House of Commons, this paper does three things. First, we examine whether transcripts capture the emotional content of speeches. We find that transcripts capture sentiment, but not emotional arousal. Second, we compare strategies for the automated analysis of sentiment in text. We find that leading approaches performed reasonably well, but sentiment dictionaries generated using word embeddings surpassed these other approaches. Finally, we test the robustness of the approach based on word embeddings. Although the methodology is reasonably robust to alternative specifications, we find that dictionaries created using word embeddings are sensitive to the choice of seed words and to training corpus size. We conclude by discussing the implications for analyses of political speech.

7,Should We Be Charlie? A Deliberative Take on Religion and Secularism in Mediated Public Spheres,"The terror attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015 serves to explore the role of religion and secularism in mediated public spheres. We argue that deliberative theory, including its recent criticisms and extensions, helps navigate normative dilemmas presented by the attacks. From a deliberative perspective, journalists should reprint Charlie cartoons that are perceived by Muslims as insulting and incendiary only if this fulfills a real need for public reflection and enlightenment. Media and the wider public should engage in differentiated solidarity with Charlie Hebdo, help transfer the hidden argumentative potential of its cartoons into the realm of truly argumentative discourse, and engage in metadeliberation that explicitly reflects the contexts and rules for public debate.

8,"News Algorithms, Photojournalism and the Assumption of Mechanical Objectivity in Journalism","This article interrogates the relationship between epistemic authority and journalistic technology through the perspective of mechanical objectivity-a belief in technological systems capable of rendering a particular output in a manner that overcomes the limits of human subjectivity. By treating journalistic objectivity not as a stable referent, but as a contextual one prone to shifts in practices and understandings over time, it foregrounds how changing technologies of recording, creating, and distributing news content affect how journalistic objectivity is understood. Following this perspective, two technological practices are examined: photojournalism and algorithms. The development of photojournalism led to the prizing of news images as objective representations produced by the camera to the diminishment of human judgment. Similarly, the various outputs produced by news algorithms are accompanied by an orientation toward computational objectivity in contrast to human subjectivity. Exploring these dynamics sheds light on the ongoing relationship between news technologies and discourses of journalistic objectivity in the face of digital innovations in the production and circulation of news.

9,Patient-Centred Communication in Ask-the-Expert Healthcare Websites,"The study presented in this article explores to what extent and in what ways the communication between clinicians and patients on Ask-the-Expert healthcare websites is patient-centred. It further demonstrates the value of using a theory and text-driven discourse analytical approach for the analysis of verbal communication in a (specific health) professional domain. The UK website Netdoctor is used as a case study. Thirty exchanges from this site, on the topic of depression, were analysed using a discourse-pragmatic framework, drawing on existing theories and definitions of patient-centred communication (PCC), a classification of empathic: cotmnunication acts (Pounds 2011) and existing research on advice giving in online communication. The analysis shows that, overall, experts make wide use of PCC, particularly empathic expression, in their online responses. The author concludes that there is a high potential for the expression of PCC on Ask-the-Expert health sites and that this may be more or less exploited, depending on the restrictions imposed on the contributors by the site managers and users' expectations

It argues that adopting such a notion to explain a diverse set of technological, political, economic, social, occupational, moral, and legal circumstances misses an opportunity to recognize how contingent and differentiated the futures of journalism might be.

11,Effects of Economic and Symbolic Threat Appeals in Right-Wing Populist Advertising on Anti-Immigrant Attitudes: The Impact of Textual and Visual Appeals,"Right-wing populist parties portray immigrants as economic or symbolic threats in their political advertisements by constructing a moral divide between the good ordinary people and bad immigrants. Yet, it remains unclear how these different threat appeals contribute to the formation of anti-immigrant attitudes among citizens and what role visual elements play in producing these effects. A survey-experiment with a quota sample of 471 participants reveals that, overall, symbolic threat appeals exert stronger effects on anti-immigrant attitudes than economic ones. When presented via text alone, only symbolicnot economicthreat appeals increased anti-immigrant attitudes via the activation of heuristic processing such as the reliance on negative stereotypes or feelings of anxiety, in particular among lower-educated citizens. When visuals were present, both types of threat appeals enhanced anti-immigrant attitudes among citizens across all education levels based on heuristic processing. Additionally, high image-text congruency induced cognitive argument approval resulting in higher anti-immigrant attitudes.

12,What the Metrics Say. The Softening of News on the Facebook Pages of Mainstream Media Outlets,"The contemporary high-choice media environment, characterized by information abundance, makes it increasingly difficult for media outlets to capture audience attention. This concern is particularly pressing for social media, and more specifically for Facebook. Because user engagement is a crucial input factor for the algorithm, fears have risen that journalistic content on digital news media and especially on social media is becoming softer to help adjust to news consumer's interests. A content analysis was conducted on four consecutive weeks of all news items published online by five market-leading Belgian media outlets (N = 10,579) in order to analyse whether the news supply is adapted to what the metrics say and, subsequently, to what extent that metric data is used to promote a softer supply of news on Facebook. To measure audience engagement, we used unique metrics provided by the news organizations themselves. The results show that audience metrics support and enhance news softening on the Facebook pages of mainstream media outlets.

13,Task complexity and transformational leadership: The mediating role of leaders' state core self-evaluations,"While substantial scholarly attention has been paid to the beneficial consequences of transformational leadership and the conditions in which this leadership style is most effective, there is a remarkable shortage of research on the contextual antecedents of transformational leadership behavior itself. To address this gap, a laboratory experiment was conducted in which we tested the relationship between task complexity and the emergence of transformational leadership behavior. In this experiment, 111 participants were divided in groups of three (comprising one leader and two subordinates), and were instructed to solve three decision-making tasks with varying levels of task complexity. Results indicated that task complexity was negatively related to transformational leadership behavior, and that this relationship was partially mediated by the leader's state core self-evaluations. In other words, when leaders encounter tasks that are overwhelmingly complex, they act in less transformational ways because they momentarily lack the psychological resources to do so. Limitations and future research directions are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

14,Aadhaar and data privacy: biometric identification and anxieties of recognition in India,"The data privacy debate in India has evolved with respect to the government's biometric identity programme, Aadhaar that enrols welfare-dependent, poor populations to grant them access to government benefits. While legal challenges to Aadhaar by civil society groups argued that the biometric identity infrastructure creates conditions of mass surveillance and violation of individual privacy, the Indian Supreme Court in 2018 ruled that the government was justified in restricting individual privacy for the collective good of providing welfare in a transparent and corruption-free manner. Given the disproportionate burden on these populations to prove their identities to the state, this paper draws on a close reading of legal and policy texts, and activist documentation to argue that there is a need to move beyond the narrative of mass surveillance as privacy violation. Data privacy interests of the welfare-dependent emerge in the moment of biometric authentication, which creates anxieties of recognition when their authentication attempts fail or are deliberately falsified. Often, to have better social mobility, they are compelled to be physically mobile in order to enrol or update their records under conditions of physical disability and meagre socioeconomic means. These anxieties illuminate their privacy interests through a compromise of dignity or dignified living, a formulation articulated in the 2018 Aadhaar verdict. The paper makes a critical contribution to the global conversation on data privacy through a discussion of the Indian case that demonstrates the privacy-recognition nexus in local contexts.

15,Letting the faculty deliberate: analyzing online deliberation in academia using a comprehensive approach,"While the scholarship on online deliberation has recently witnessed remarkable growth, most studies have focused on different parts of deliberation, thus neglecting other parts of the theorized process. This paper presents a case study of online deliberation in academia using a framework including three analytical parts: a design fostering deliberation (institutional inputs), the quality of the communication process (communicative throughput), and the expected benefits of deliberation (productive outcomes). Each level addressed in the framework is both rooted in deliberative theory and complemented by empirical findings. Applying the framework to a case study on online deliberation about new PhD guidelines in a German science faculty demonstrates that the framework is viable for empirical research. In analyzing 435 comments and an online survey completed by 230 participants, the case study reveals that if deliberative standards at the institutional input level are met there is considerable deliberative quality at the level of communicative throughput, and expected outcomes could thus emerge. This example makes a case for further online deliberation initiatives in similar contexts such as parties or organizations that must decide on important issues or legally binding norms.

17,"Multilingualism, Chronotopes, and Resolutions: Toward an Analysis of the Total Sociolinguistic Fact","In this article, I argue for a chronotopic-scalar system of images and resolutions in the analysis of language use in general and multilingual practices in particular. Drawing on data from Iranian Azerbaijanis, I argue that availability and accessibility of linguistic/semiotic resources, and their categorizations as languages or language varieties, are constrained by participants' chronotopization histories. That is, the scaled images participants develop through socialization about different time-space frames and the peoples, relations, discourses, and resources therein guide their language use both from and about particular contexts. I discuss the utility of spatiotemporal understandings of repertoires of resources and normalcies in capturing the variability, dynamicity, and complexity of semiotic practices and also in addressing the controversies among scholars regarding the 'realness' of languages and hybridity of multilingual practices. Through decentralizing language(s) and foregrounding context(s) and contextualization, I argue, the chronotope enables us to analyze not only social actors' hybrid utilization of semiotic resources in meaning-making processes, but also their language ideologies and language-ideological practices, which rely heavily on the perceptions of languages as discrete systems.

18,"When Talk Trumps Text: The Democratizing Effects of Deliberation during Constitution-Making, 1974-2011","Under what circumstances do new constitutions promote democracy? Between 1974 and 2011, the level of democracy increased in 62 countries following the adoption of a new constitution, but decreased or stayed the same in 70 others. Using data covering all 138 new constitutions in 118 countries during that period, we explain this divergence through empirical tests showing that overall increased participation during the process of making the constitution positively impacts postpromulgation levels of democracy. Then, after disaggregating constitution-making into three stages (drafting, debating, and ratification) we find compelling evidence through robust statistical tests that the degree of citizen participation in the drafting stage has amuch greater impact on the resulting regime. This lends support to some core principles of 'deliberative' theories of democracy. We conclude that constitutional reformers should focus more on generating public 'buy in' at the front end of the constitution-making process, rather than concentrating on ratification and referendums at the 'back end' that are unlikely to correct for an 'original sin' of limited citizen deliberation during drafting.

19,International Publishing as A Networked Activity: Collegial Support for Chinese Scientists,"Writing for international publication is a daunting prospect for all scholars but is particularly difficult for those off-network academics writing in an additional language. With little institutional support, they may solicit help from colleagues and other text mediators who do not share authorship. In this article, we investigate the experiences of 31 Chinese scientists seeking to publish in English, following their writing practices and use of discursive support by colleagues. We found that colleagues, although a valuable resource, were at best part of the solution. Many also turned to noncolleague text mediators, but with only limited success. Our study points to the need that institutions in non-Anglophone settings may need to sponsor systematic support to their scholars striving for international publication.

20,"Instrumentalizing Fukushima: Comparing Media Coverage of Fukushima in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland","According to the theory of instrumental actualization in mediated conflicts, the mass media tend to exaggerate events consistent with the editorial line. This theory was tested using press coverage in Germany, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom on the Japanese seaquake, the tsunami it caused, and the nuclear disaster of Fukushima. Within a period of seven weeks after the seaquake, the coverage in the four countries in 27 national newspapers and magazines on the three events was analyzed. As hypothesized from theory, German and Swiss media concentrated on Fukushima and stressed its relevance to domestic nuclear plants, whereas French and British media placed a greater emphasis on the tsunami and rarely related the nuclear catastrophe in Japan to domestic nuclear programs. In addition, there were remarkable correlations between the views of journalists and the bias of statements on nuclear energy presented in their news sections. Findings are discussed and related to the theory of public opinion and political decisions in liberal democracies.

21,ON THE STREET AND/OR ON TWITTER? The use of every day sources in economic news coverage by online and offline outlets,"By means of a large-scale manual content analysis of Dutch economic news coverage in 2015 (n = 4251 articles), we compare the use of every day sources by online and offline outlets. The use of those sources is argued to increase news consumers' attentiveness to the news item. We investigate whether online outlets use the ordinary citizen less frequently, both generally speaking as well as a source, while relying more on social media posts. Our empirical analysis focuses on a comparison between two online quality outlets (nrc.nl and vk.nl), two online popular outlets (nu.nl and telegraaf.nl), two offline quality outlets (NRC Handelsblad and de Volkskrant) and two offline popular outlets (Algemeen Dablad and de Telegraaf). Overall, results suggest a limited use of ordinary citizens as news sources, and even less use of social media. Multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for the length of news items as well as the day of publishing, 'show that offline outlets use ordinary citizens more often, while online outlets rely more on social media'. Additionally, we find the differences between popular and quality outlets a lot less pronounced, with the latter only making slight more use of social media sources.

22,Don't Turn a Deaf Ear: A Case for Assessing Interactive Listening,"The reciprocal nature of spoken interaction means that participants constantly alternate between speaker and listener roles. However, listener or recipient actions-also known as interactive listening (IL)-are somewhat underrepresented in language tests. In conventional listening tests, they are not directly assessed. In speaking tests, they have often been overshadowed by an emphasis on production features or subsumed under broader constructs such as interactional competence. This article is an effort to represent the rich IL phenomena that can be found in peer interactive speaking assessments, where the candidate-candidate format and discussion task offer opportunities to elicit and assess IL. Taking a close look at candidate discourse and nonverbal actions through a conversation analytic approach, the analysis focuses on three IL features (i) listenership displays, (ii) contingent responses, and (iii) collaborative completions, and unpacks their relative strength in evidencing listener understanding. This article concludes by making a case for revisiting the role of IL, calling for more explicit inclusion of IL in L2 assessment as well as pedagogy.

23,THE NOTION OF THE 'BLURRING BOUNDARIES' Journalism as a (de-) differentiated phenomenon,"The notion of the 'blurring boundaries' has become a flashy label to characterize the way journalism is manifestly changing in the age of the internet. This article explores this idea of de-boundedness and discusses the question whether there is anything more behind it than a catch-all diagnosis for the processes of change and transformation in the circumstances of communication in society, in general, and for journalism, in particular. To this end, de-boundedness as a proposition initially receives a more concrete definition. Its foundations in theories of differentiation and especially in the theory of social systems by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann will be discussed, where differentiation, that is, drawing lines of demarcation, is the essential factor. It is shown that systems theory provides different possibilities for characterizing forms of de-differentiation or 'blurring boundaries'. Within systems theory they can be interpreted in terms of the evolutionary emergence of new forms of journalism, the co-evolutionary processes between journalism and its environment and/or as interpenetrations of journalism with other societal systems. It is demonstrated that changes in journalism oscillate between differentiation and de-differentiation, so that it can be described as a (de-) differentiated phenomenon.

24,"Alternative media for a populist audience? Exploring political and media use predictors of exposure to Breitbart, Sputnik, and Co.","Alongside the recent rise of political populism, a new type of alternative media has established in past years that allegedly contribute to the distribution of the populist narrative. Using a large-scale quota survey of German Internet users (n=1346) we investigate political and media use predictors of exposure to alternative media with an affinity to populism (AMP). Results reveal substantial differences between occasional and frequent AMP users. While both groups heavily use Twitter and Facebook for political information, occasional AMP users exhibit hardly any specific political convictions (except that they feel less personally deprived than non-users). Contrary to that, frequent AMP exposure is related to higher personal relative deprivation, stronger populist attitudes and a higher likelihood to vote for the right-wing populist party AfD. Against this background, frequent AMP use can be interpreted as partisan selective exposure whereas occasional AMP exposure might result from incidental contact via social media platforms. These findings are discussed regarding the role of alternative and social media in the recent populism wave.

Scholars are increasingly using text-as-data methods for social science inquiry, driving a need for more training and professionalization of computational political communication as a sub-field. Text-as-data methods are largely borrowed from other disciplines such as linguistics and computer science, but sustained, institutionalized collaboration between scholars in different departments is still somewhat rare. Using the concept of cohesion as an example, I describe how multiple disciplines interpret and operationalize the same term in different ways. Finally, I provide a list of challenges and lessons learned, including the logistics of running a lab, communicating and publishing across disciplines, implications of authorship sequence, and maintaining your own research profile while collaborating. I conclude by discussing the role of meaningful mentorship and future directions for interdisciplinary text analysis research.

27,Computer-Assisted Keyword and Document Set Discovery from Unstructured Text,"The (unheralded) first step in many applications of automated text analysis involves selecting keywords to choose documents from a large text corpus for further study. Although all substantive results depend on this choice, researchers usually pick keywords in ad hoc ways that are far from optimal and usually biased. Most seem to think that keyword selection is easy, since they do Google searches every day, but we demonstrate that humans perform exceedingly poorly at this basic task. We offer a better approach, one that also can help with following conversations where participants rapidly innovate language to evade authorities, seek political advantage, or express creativity; generic web searching; eDiscovery; look-alike modeling; industry and intelligence analysis; and sentiment and topic analysis. We develop a computer-assisted (as opposed to fully automated or human-only) statistical approach that suggests keywords from available text without needing structured data as inputs. This framing poses the statistical problem in a new way, which leads to a widely applicable algorithm. Our specific approach is based on training classifiers, extracting information from (rather than correcting) their mistakes, and summarizing results with easy-to-understand Boolean search strings. We illustrate how the technique works with analyses of English texts about the Boston Marathon bombings, Chinese social media posts designed to evade censorship, and others.

The proximity of security concerns in language testing with broader national immigration policy objectives suggests a complex role for language tests as gatekeeping devices. This article draws on critical discourse studies to explore this issue. Documents provided in the 2014 tender round for selecting Secure English Language Tests (acquired through a Freedom of Information request) were analysed through a discourse-historical lens (Reisigl and Wodak 2016) to map salient topics and identify discursive strategies used to construct 'secure English language testing'. Findings show that security is a prominent topic in the tender; prospective bidders are required to meet detailed security requirements and to police subcontractors, and social actors, spaces, objects, policies and procedures are routinely described in securitized terms. Implications are drawn for understanding the role of language tests within broader securitization processes.

To this end, discursive opportunity structure was adopted as the main theoretical framework. In addition, in-depth interviews with key Indonesian journalists, social media activists and media scholars were conducted to examine the issue.

31,The Watchdog Role of Fact-Checkers in Different Media Systems,"The article aims to capture the diversity of emerging practices in fact-checking by exploring, on the one side, journalists' self-perception of the watchdog role they believe to perform and, on the other, the effective occurrence of such a role in different media systems. Data regarding the perception of the watchdog role stem from the Worlds of Journalism Survey, whereas evidence concerning the presence of the watchdog function derives from a content analysis of 2,792 fact-checks published by FactCheck.org (United States), Pagella Politica (Italy), Correctiv (Germany), and Lupa (Brazil). While fact-checkers working for Correctiv rarely addressed declarations by political agents, those contributing to FactCheck.org prioritized verifying statements by former President Trump. In turn, Pagella Politica fact-checkers recurrently used assertive labels to stress the falsehood of public remarks, whilst true is the most used label in the Lupa case. There is correspondence between professionals' conceptions about their role and the watchdog stance agencies perform in most cases. The manuscript also discusses how idiosyncrasies featuring each professional culture and specific traits of media systems influence fact-checkers' work. Lastly, we hold that in some settings fact-checking may outline new frontiers for the notion of watchdog journalism, taking the journalistic voice to unprecedented levels of adversarialism.

32,Making sense? The structure and meanings of digital memetic nonsense,"This paper offers the first systematic analysis of 'digital memetic nonsense'-clusters of seemingly meaningless digital texts imitated and circulated by many participants. We evaluated this phenomenon through two conceptual lenses: theories on nonsense in the pre-digital age and the techno-cultural conditions that facilitate its contemporary formations. A grounded analysis of 139 nonsensical memes led to their typology into 5 genres: linguistic silliness, embodied silliness, pastiche, dislocations, and interruptions. In each of these genres, we show how digital nonsense may potentially serve as a social glue that bonds members of phatic, image-oriented, communities. If, in the past, nonsense was depicted in both intellectual terms, as defiant deconstruction of meaning, and in playful/ social terms, its current memetic manifestations lean heavily toward the latter. Rather than being a reflection on ` referential meaning', digital nonsense is analyzed as a generative source of ` affective meaning' that marks the formation of social connections preceding cognitive understanding. We conclude by highlighting the potentially subversive implications of this shift for participatory barriers and community membership.

33,"Killing in the Slums: Social Order, Criminal Governance, and Police Violence in Rio de Janeiro","State interventions against organized criminal groups (OCGs) sometimes work to improve security, but often exacerbate violence. To understand why, this article offers a theory about criminal governance in five types of criminal regimes-Insurgent, Bandit, Symbiotic, Predatory, and Split. These differ according to whether criminal groups confront or collude with state actors, abuse or cooperate with the community, and hold a monopoly or contest territory with rival OCGs. Police interventions in these criminal regimes pose different challenges and are associated with markedly different local security outcomes. We provide evidence of this theory by using a multimethod research design combining quasi-experimental statistical analyses, automated text analysis, extensive qualitative research, and a large-N survey in the context of Rio de Janeiro's 'Pacifying Police Units' (UPPs), which sought to reclaim control of the favelas from criminal organizations.

34,"Data privacy and political distrust: corporate 'pro liars,' 'gridlocked Congress,' and the Twitter issue public around the US privacy legislation","This study explores how emerging US data privacy regulations are discussed at state and federal levels, examining Twitter discourse around Senate public hearings on data privacy and public forums on the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The recent legal steps reflect growing public outcry over corporate data misuses and lack of appropriate legislation. The findings suggest that the issue public of Twitter users in this study largely considered corporations and the government as untrustworthy actors for privacy legislation. The political distrust was raising doubts over regulatory capture and if a future US federal privacy law will be weaker than state laws (e.g., CCPA) while overriding them. The study explores implications of the findings on the current deadlock over the state preemption clause in developing a comprehensive federal privacy law. I argue that the emerging regulatory efforts on data privacy may not be effective unless the public trust in institutions is regained in the US and that the continuing absence of a federal law amid the political distrust can leave people with limited individual privacy strategies as a result.

35,Violence Against Civilians During Armed Conflict: Moving Beyond the Macro- and Micro-Level Divide,"Early research on wartime violence against civilians highlighted a distinction between macro- and micro-level approaches. Macro-level approaches, grounded in the international relations subfield, focus on variation across countries or conflicts, while micro-level approaches, more influenced by the comparative politics subfield, focus on variation within countries or conflicts. However, some of the recent research on civilian targeting does not fit neatly into this dichotomy-such as research comparing subnational units or armed groups across conflicts or research relying on geo-referenced event data for multiple conflicts. We review the literature and advocate moving beyond the language of the micro- and macro-level divide, instead focusing on the determinants of violence against civilians at five different levels of analysis: international, domestic, subnational, organizational, and individual. While acknowledging significant advances in the field, we argue for continued research aimed at developing a more integrated theoretical understanding of the multiple actors and interactive social processes driving violence against civilians.

36,Intra-Caribbean Solidarities and the Language of Social Protest,"This essay explores the language of social protest in two geographic and diasporic locations in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic) with long and ongoing histories of colonialism and imperialism. We analyze social media and digital mobilizing to examine how, in the midst of social protest, linguistic and semiotic tools indexed historicity, contemporaneity, and futurity through relational strategies that are not just textual and discursive, but also historical, social, and political. Throughout this essay, we share examples of intertextual and interdiscursive strategies that marked particular moments of protest as articulations of historical precedents, imperial and colonial presents, and alternative futures. These examples reveal how collective identities (i.e. el pueblo) are mobilized in social protest to generate counternarratives that address structures and systems rather than locate social critiques in particular individuals and political parties. In shedding light on the intra-Caribbean solidarities that emerge over time, this analysis also points to a need to examine the erasures (Gal and Irvine 2019) performed through claims to unity and collective organizing.

37,Evidence for the Adoption of the Flemma as an Appropriate Word Counting Unit,"An important gap in the field of second language vocabulary research concerns the ability of Asian learners of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) to comprehend inflectional and derivational word family members. Japanese EFL learners (N=279) were divided into three lexical proficiency groups, and their ability to comprehend inflectional and derivational English forms was measured with an English to Japanese translation test. A significant difference among the participants' ability to comprehend 12 base forms, associated inflected forms, and associated derived forms was found across the three proficiency groups, and even among participants who demonstrated mastery of the first 4,000 or 5,000 base forms of English. The flemma, a word's base form and associated inflectional forms, was found to be an appropriate word counting unit for most participants. Results are important because corpus research findings demonstrate that in cases where the word family provides 98 per cent coverage of texts, the flemma only provides 85 per cent coverage of the same texts. Thus, considering the detrimental impact to reading comprehension from only small decreases in the percentage of known tokens within a text, the results question the inferences made in word family-based research.

38,"'I mean, in my opinion, I have it the worst, because I am white. I am male. I am heterosexual': questioning the inclusivity of reconfigured hegemonic masculinities in a UK student online culture","This paper critically examines how gendered hierarchies and relations, particularly those between hegemonic masculinities and non-hegemonic gendered identities, manifest between students at a university in North West England in and through forms of online harassment, using data collected from a large-scale study (N= 810) conducted in this institutional context. Key findings indicate that some young masculinities subordinate non-hegemonic gendered identities, namely those who identify as female and transgender, in and through gendered and sexualised forms of online harassment or are complicit in these practices. Male research participants are more likely than any other gendered group to use 'free speech' discourses to legitimate online harassment directed at transgendered and cis-female subjects. Some white, heterosexual males, who occupy a dominant position in Britain's gendered and racial social order, appropriate discursive practices associated with identity politics, which have historically been used by non-hegemonic gendered identities to challenge social inequities, to claim they are 'victims' of this society. We argue that these new emerging forms of hybridised hegemonic masculinity, which appropriate and reconfigure the discursive practices of non-hegemonic gendered identities, reproduce and conceal patriarchal systems of power in digitised spaces. We suggest more research is needed to better understand these practices, their relationship to alt-right influencers and men's rights activists, and their implications for digital hegemonic masculinities at the local level of UK university campuses.

39,Combining Outcome-Based and Preference-Based Matching: A Constrained Priority Mechanism,"We introduce a constrained priority mechanism that combines outcome-based matching from machine learning with preference-based allocation schemes common in market design. Using real-world data, we illustrate how our mechanism could be applied to the assignment of refugee families to host country locations, and kindergarteners to schools. Our mechanism allows a planner to first specify a threshold g for the minimum acceptable average outcome score that should be achieved by the assignment. In the refugee matching context, this score corresponds to the probability of employment, whereas in the student assignment context, it corresponds to standardized test scores. The mechanism is a priority mechanism that considers both outcomes and preferences by assigning agents (refugee families and students) based on their preferences, but subject to meeting the planner's specified threshold. The mechanism is both strategy-proof and constrained efficient in that it always generates a matching that is not Pareto dominated by any other matching that respects the planner's threshold.

40,Putting Politics First: The Impact of Politics on American Religious and Secular Orientations,"Nearly all research on the political impact of Americans' religious and secular orientations assumes that such orientations are exogenous to politics. Using multiwave panel and experimental data, we find that religious and secular orientations are endogenous to political orientations. In other words, religion and secularism are a consequence as well as a cause of politics. In showing this, we make three major contributions. First, we conceptualize and measure secular orientations in a new way-not just as the absence of religion, but also as an affirmative secular identity and positive commitment to secular principles. Second, our panel and experimental data allow for the most definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal effect on religious and secular orientations. Third, we isolate the conditions under which politics affects religious-secular perspectives, thus identifying the mechanism that underlies political orientations.

41,Emotional consequences and attention rewards: the social effects of ratings on Reddit,"Rating features on social media platforms affect visibility algorithms and act as symbolic markers of evaluation. This paper addresses the social effects of content ratings through a case study of Reddit. Reddit is a social news site on which users in topic-based communities (subreddits) create posts upon which others upvote, downvote, and comment. Vote scores indicate convergence with, and divergence from, community norms. Analysing data from the platform's three most popular subreddits, we ask: How do rating features afford emotional expression and content engagement? Findings from a Variable-Lag Granger Causality model show that for a portion of Reddit users (14.5%), vote scores predict subsequent emotional expression, with upvotes preceding positive sentiments and downvotes preceding negative sentiments. This is the first systematic test of how ratings influence emotional expression on a social media platform. Findings also show that downvoted content receives higher levels of engagement than upvoted content. Together, these findings suggest a paradox in which divergence from community norms, as indicated by vote score patterns, have emotional consequences and attention rewards.

42,Conversation Patterns between Children with Severe Speech Impairment and their Conversation Partners in Dyadic and Multi-person Interactions,"Active engagement in interactions is crucial for the development of identity, social competence, and cognitive abilities. For children with severe speech impairment (SSI) who have little or no intelligible speech, active participation in conversations is challenging and can be critical for their social inclusion and participation. The present study investigated the conversational patterns emerging from interactions between children with SSI who use aided communication and typically speaking conversation partners (CPs) and explored whether active participation was different in interactions with different numbers of partners (dyadic versus multi-person interactions). An unusually large multilingual dataset was used (N = 85 conversations). This allowed us to systematically investigate discourse analysis measures indicating participation: the distribution of conversational control (initiations versus responses versus recodes) and summoning power (obliges versus comments). The findings suggest that (i) conversations were characterized by asymmetrical conversational patterns with CPs assuming most of the conversational control and (ii) multi-person interactions were noticeably more symmetric compared to dyadic, as children's active participation in multi-person interactions was significantly increased. Clinical implications and best practice recommendations are discussed.

44,The filtered self: selfies and gendered media production,"In 2013, the Oxford English Dictionary selected 'selfie' as the word of the year. Since that time, selfies have been much discussed in the media and increasingly in academia. Selfie culture is gendered not only because women take more selfies than men but also because women's selfie-taking is both criticized (as narcissistic) and defended (as empowering) on feminist grounds. In this paper, we draw upon the existing literature on selfies as well as 260, short 'person-on-the-street' interviews with young people (mostly Latinas, mostly in California) about their selfie-taking practices to demonstrate that selfies are indeed a gendered genre and an important if the overlooked form of gendered media production in a postfeminist context. The data reveal the disciplinary function of the narcissism narrative for young women, their navigation of gendered and sexual double-standards as well their understandings of 'publicness' when posting selfies, their ambivalence about feedback, and their commitment to individualized notions of empowerment realized through 'control' of the gaze. We argue that self-production is never simply about the self because cultural filters are at work that shape in systematic ways how women envision and enact female subjectivity and visibility. Our goal is not to determine whether selfies are good or bad; rather, we explore what they suggest about the gendered politics of self-production for young women of color in the new 'gaze economy' of social media.

An abiding conflict between market logics and journalistic norms underscores the broader danger in knitting together neoliberal ideals of entrepreneurialism and startup culture with notions of how journalists can and should respond to financial and cultural threats of digital innovation to their industry.

I argue that Mexican insurgents deployed Indigenous genealogies to instantiate what I call 'restorative revolution,' a form of revolutionary thinking that prioritized memorialization over absolute foundation. Mexico's restorative project began with calls for the return of the Anahuac Empire, an Indigenous genealogy that memorialized histories of popular self-rule to legitimize postcolonial demands. I suggest that the Anahuac movement transformed the principles of radical republican thought by mobilizing around religious, plebeian, and hemispheric identities. Each of these characteristics problematizes dominant interpretations of republicanism as a secular, elite, and national enterprise.

47,INTERACTION AND INFLUENCE ON TWITTER Comparing the discourse relationships between user types on five topics,"The internet and social media have led to a change in the structure of the public sphere in comparison to traditional mass media. On the internet, private actors have the possibility to participate in public discourse and bypass news media to directly interact with each other as well as with public actors such as political representatives. The questions of the type of interaction, the degree of influence, and possible topic-specific differences, however, remain unclear. We conducted a content analysis of the user types, forms of interaction, and practices of retweeting and linking in 17,629 tweets on five topics and found topic-specific differences in the interaction between news media, public actors, and private actors. Overall, news media still hold an important role in information flow and are linked to and retweeted most often by all user types.

48,Coalitional Lobbying and Intersectional Representation in American Rulemaking,"Interest groups representing the marginalized regularly neglect advocacy on behalf of their most vulnerable constituents-those with intersectional disadvantage. Yet, they claim that such advocacy is central to their missions. I argue that interest groups representing women, people of color, Native nations, and the poor strategically conduct intersectional advocacy through coalitional lobbying. I test this claim using a new dataset of cosignature patterns within public comments on proposed federal agency rules submitted by a set of such groups between 2004 and 2014. I find that these groups are significantly more likely to pursue intersectional advocacy in coalitions but that coalition work, alone, does not relate to influential intersectional advocacy. Rather, it is particular coalition characteristics, including organizational diversity and financial capacity, that predict such influence. I conclude that collaborative lobbying is an effective tactic for mediating representational bias in interest group advocacy and promoting more pluralistic administrative policy making.

49,"Creating the collective: social media, the Occupy Movement and its constitution as a collective actor","This paper examines the process through which Occupy activists came to constitute themselves as a collective actor and the role of social media in this process. The theoretical framework combines Melucci's (1996) theory of collective identity with insights from the field of organizational communication and particularly from the CCO' strand - short for Communication is Constitutive of Organizing'. This allows us to conceptualize collective identity as an open-ended and dynamic process that is constructed in conversations and codified in texts. Based on interviews with Occupy activists in NewYork, London and other cities, I then discuss the communication processes through which the movement was drawing the boundaries with its environment, creating codes and foundational documents, as well as speaking in a collective voice. The findings show that social media tended to blur the boundaries between the inside and the outside of the movement in a way that suited its values of inclusiveness and direct participation. Social media users could also follow remotely the meetings of the general assembly where the foundational documents were ratified, but their voices were not included in the process. The presence of the movement on social media also led to conflicts and negotiations around Occupy's collective voice as constructed on these platforms. Thus, viewing the movement as a phenomenon emerging in communication allows us an insight into the efforts of Occupy activists to create a collective that was both inclusive of the 99% and a distinctive actor with its own identity.

While it discusses the role of social media in the Occupy Movement, it does not explicitly mention the use of Computational Text Analysis Methods (IC1). The focus is on the theoretical framework of collective identity and organizational communication, rather than on analyzing social science constructs through computational methods (IC2). Additionally, the study does not have a clear focus on political communication as defined by the criteria (IC3), as it centers on the internal dynamics and identity formation of a social movement rather than political discourse or media framing of political issues. Therefore, it does not meet the necessary inclusion criteria and should be excluded.",012,BM,SYS_001,USR_001,gpt-4o,0.0,2025-08-14T13:08:43.209419

**Reasoning:** The abstract is missing, which makes it impossible to determine if the study meets the inclusion criteria. Without information on whether computational text analysis methods are used (IC1), if social science constructs are analyzed (IC2), or if there is a focus on political communication (IC3), the study cannot be included. Additionally, the title alone does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm the use of computational methods or a focus on political communication, which are necessary for inclusion.",012,BM,SYS_001,USR_001,gpt-4o,0.0,2025-08-14T13:08:45.963169
