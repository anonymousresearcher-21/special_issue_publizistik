1,{Online MEDIA within the public service realm?: Reasons to include online into the public service mission},"Public service media are no longer limited to radio and television as new media genres emerge. Among others, the online medium has supplemented radio, television and the press since the mid-1990s and has become a medium in its own right. Moreover, online media have become essential elements of media consumption patterns. Public service media compete not only with private radio and television broadcasters but also with the press. The question arises, whether such competition in the online field results in more diversity and higher output quality, serving the public interest better. In Europe, there are at least two different schools of thought. One line of argument accepts the public service expansion into online media and regards online media as a necessary and important field for public service activities. Another line of argument suggests limiting the public service remit strictly to radio and broadcasting and considers online media as an emerging market subject to competition among private companies only. Based on the results of a comparative empirical analysis of online media provided by public service broadcasters and print publishers in Switzerland, Germany and Austria (from 2006) this article shows that the achieved results in media output are disappointing. Only few online media live up to the expectations. The article finally argues that the extension of the public service remit to online media might enhance quality and diversity.

2,{Observing SERENDIPity in digital information environments},"We often interact with digital information environments to find useful information. But sometimes useful information finds us unexpectedly, propelling us in new and exciting directions. We might come across information serendipitously when looking for information on something else, or when we are not looking for anything in particular. In previous studies, people have self-reported that they come across information serendipitously. However, there has been limited success in directly observing people doing so. To see if we could have more success, we conducted naturalistic observations of 45 users interacting with different types of digital information environments. Without priming them about serendipity, we asked the users to conduct self-chosen naturalistic information tasks, which varied from broad tasks such as browsing online news to narrow tasks such as finding a particular product to buy. We noted several examples where users either 1) stated they were looking for information on a particular topic or product and unexpectedly found useful/potentially useful information about something else or 2) unexpectedly found useful/potentially useful information when not looking for anything in particular. Our findings suggest that, with a carefully-considered approach, serendipity-related information interaction behaviour can be directly observed. Direct observation allows designers of digital information environments to better understand this behaviour and use this understanding to reason about ways of designing new or improving existing support for serendipity.

3,{Actor DIVERSity and viewpoint DIVERSity: Two of a kind?},"News content diversity is generally considered to be an essential
precondition for the promotion of social pluralism. However, how
diversity of news content should be conceptualized and measured is less
clear. We use a content analysis of newspaper articles about immigration
(2013-14) in Belgium (Flanders) to measure the diversity of actors and
viewpoints in the news, and to study the link between those two
subdimensions of content diversity. We find that the representation of a
plurality of active actors in a news article seems to go hand in hand
with a more diverse range of viewpoints. The findings show that there
are no significant differences in the level of actor and viewpoint
diversity between quality and popular newspapers. However, the length of
the article has a positive effect on providing more diversity. Moreover,
our results indicate that allowing for individual immigrants to talk in

4,"{FILTER BUBBLEs, ECHO CHAMBERs, and online NEWS consumption}","Online publishing, social networks, and web search have dramatically
lowered the costs of producing, distributing, and discovering news
articles. Some scholars argue that such technological changes increase
exposure to diverse perspectives, while others worry that they increase
ideological segregation. We address the issue by examining web-browsing
histories for 50,000 US-located users who regularly read online news. We
find that social networks and search engines are associated with an
increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals. However,
somewhat counterintuitively, these same channels also are associated
with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from his or her
less preferred side of the political spectrum. Finally, the vast
majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals
simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream,
news outlets, tempering the consequences-both positive and negative-of
recent technological changes. We thus uncover evidence for both sides of

5,{Democracy and the press: A comparative analysis of PLURALism in the international print MEDIA},"The relationship between democracy and press pluralism is assessed in seven countries: China, Colombia, Egypt, Germany, India, Lithuania, and Russia. The term ""pluralism"" is defined as the extent to which diverse and competing views appear in the content of the mainstream press on a given news topic. Content analysis of 2,172 articles from the 10 largest newspapers in each country, published in the first months after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, is used to evaluate the level of press pluralism. The main indicator of democracy is based on data from the Freedom House organization, though other democracy indexes are considered. Previous studies have offered conflicting views on the relationship between democracy and press pluralism. Although this study finds mixed results, the general tendency, which is based on 10 major news issues surrounding the events of 9/11, supports the perspective that democracy is not always positively associated with press pluralism. Much of the debate over 9/11 in countries ranked as highly democratic was less pluralistic than in countries with weaker democratic institutions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

6,{Sports organizations in a new wave of MEDIAtization},"This article explores the transforming effects of digital media in
sports organizations. The approach to this is an analytical focus on a
wide range of sports, which are examined from an institutional and
organizational approach to mediatization theory. On the basis of an
empirical study of governing sports organizations (national sports
federations), it is demonstrated that digital media are a major concern
across organizations and that a new wave of mediatization is taking
place in sports. Still, many organizations struggle with this and
currently find themselves in a state of flux, trying to involve
employees, volunteers, and external partners with communication
competencies in their activities in various ways, on many levels, and
for many varying purposes. Consequently, one of the significant effects
of digital media is a dispersion of communication involving more people
and concurrent increase in internal complexity in many organizations.
Mediatization is therefore a process that is very much in operation at
many levels and at various speeds, but it also takes organizations in
diverse directions. Using Thornton and Ocasio's interinstitutional
approach and concept of institutional logics, it is argued and
demonstrated that this is because these sports organizations have other
relevant and powerful institutional partners or organizations that need
to be considered in the process as well.",False,False,0,0,EXCLUDE,0,"**Decision:** EXCLUDE

7,{For everything a season? A month-by-month analysis of SOCIAL NETWORK resources in later life},"It is widely acknowledged that informal social ties provide older persons with many resources that serve to protect and improve their levels of health and well-being. Most studies on this topic, however, ignore the month or season of the year during which data was accumulated. This study proposes two hypotheses to explain seniors' social network resources over the calendar year: the “fluctuation hypothesis”, which proposes that seasonal variation, in the form of weather fluctuations, institutional calendars, and holidays, might influence the social lives and resources of older persons, and the “network stability” perspective, which, informed by tenets of convoy theory and socioemotional selectivity theory, emphasizes the increasing importance of close network ties as individuals age and the stability of these ties. Using two waves (2005–2006 and 2010–2011) of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older adults aged 57–85 in the United States, we examine a diverse set of nine social connectedness outcomes. Results, overall, support the network stability perspective, as the only social connectedness outcome found to significantly vary by month of year was average closeness with network members. We conclude by suggesting some methodological considerations for survey research and by noting how these findings complement the growing literature on inter-year fluctuation in social networks and social support. Changes in older adults' networks, while frequently observable over the course of years, do not seem to be seasonally patterned. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc.",False,False,0,0,EXCLUDE,0,"**Decision:** EXCLUDE

11,{Communication and Exchange of Specialized Health-Related Support Among People With Experiential Similarity on FACEBOOK},"Social support is an important factor that shapes how people cope with illness, and health-related communication among peers managing the same illness (network ties with experiential similarity) offers specialized information, resources, and emotional support. Facebook has become a ubiquitous part of many Americans' lives, and may offer a way for patients and caregivers experiencing a similar illness to exchange specialized health-related support. However, little is known about the content of communication among people who have coped with the same illness on personal Facebook pages. We conducted a content analysis of 12 months of data from 18 publicly available Facebook pages hosted by parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, focusing on communication between users who self-identified as parents of pediatric cancer patients. Support exchanges between users with experiential similarity contained highly specialized health-related information, including information about health services use, symptom recognition, compliance, medication use, treatment protocols, and medical procedures. Parents also exchanged tailored emotional support through comparison, empathy, encouragement, and hope. Building upon previous research documenting that social media use can widen and diversify support networks, our findings show that cancer caregivers access specialized health-related informational and emotional support through communication with others who have experienced the same illness on personal Facebook pages.

13,{Towards DIVERSity in young adult fiction: Australian YA authors' publishing experiences and its implications for YA librarians and readers' advisory services},"Based on a study of Australian young adult (YA) fiction authors, this paper argues that it is necessary for publishers, booksellers, and YA librarians to pay attention to the global movement towards diversity: diversity within their own organisations, diversity among authors they publish, stock, or collect, and representations of diversity within YA fiction. The mainstream attention to diversity has particularly focused on media for young people, with advocates stating that children and teenagers from traditionally marginalised communities deserve to see their own experiences reflected and validated in the media they consume. This paper looks at diversity in writing and traditional publishing through interviews with Australian YA authors (conducted in 2016) from traditionally marginalised or unacknowledged communities, especially as it relates to their transition from reader to writer, and their experience of the publishing journey. A critical discourse analysis of the interviews point to a need for more diversity representations in YA fiction, and also the need for a change in industry practices to enable this, including publishing, bookselling, and library practices.

14,{Reinventing the heights: the origins of rockclimbing culture in Australia},"Australian rockclimbing culture and climbers have been imagined in a
particular way with the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century
press playing a key role. Australian landscapes, including mountains,
were incorporated into Indigenous cosmology for millennia before
Aboriginal people discovered Europeans. But with the colonial invasion,
the very nature of the landscape in the new colony meant that climbing
culture was bound to take on a different persona from its European
antecedent and undergo a rethinking or reinvention process. Figuring
strongly in this discursive reconstruction was the particular geography
of one region in Australia - southeast Queensland - with its diverse
collection of volcanic peaks within range of a major population centre,
along with a climate that encouraged the emergence of a set of
complementary leisure activities. This article explores the emergence of
rockclimbing culture in Australia from a range of often competing and
contradictory discourses - Aboriginal cosmology, a unique landscape, the
influence of the European idea of climbing and charismatic, visionary
individuals. From the turn of the twentieth century, the role of local
newspapers and magazines was a crucial element in this imagining process
creating briefly a space for female climbers that has only recently been
reclaimed. From the late 1880s, and particularly during the 1920s and

15,{SCENT: Scalable Compressed Monitoring of Evolving Multirelational SOCIAL NETWORKs},"We propose SCENT, an innovative, scalable spectral analysis framework
for internet scale monitoring of multirelational social media data,
encoded in the form of tensor streams. In particular, a significant
challenge is to detect key changes in the social media data, which could
reflect important events in the real world, sufficiently quickly. Social
media data have three challenging characteristics. First, data sizes are
enormous; recent technological advances allow hundreds of millions of
users to create and share content within online social networks. Second,
social data are often multifaceted (i.e., have many dimensions of
potential interest, from the textual content to user metadata). Finally,
the data is dynamic; structural changes can occur at multiple time
scales and be localized to a subset of users. Consequently, a framework
for extracting useful information from social media data needs to scale
with data volume, and also with the number and diversity of the facets
of the data. In SCENT, we focus on the computational cost of structural
change detection in tensor streams. We extend compressed sensing (CS) to
tensor data. We show that, through the use of randomized tensor
ensembles, SCENT is able to encode the observed tensor streams in the
form of compact descriptors. We show that the descriptors allow very
fast detection of significant spectral changes in the tensor stream,
which also reduce data collection, storage, and processing costs.

16,{Understanding NEWS sharing in SOCIAL MEDIA: An explanation from the diffusion of innovations theory},"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to draw from the diffusion of innovations theory to explore multi-levels of influences (i.e. individuals, networks, news attributes) on news sharing in social media. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was designed and administered to 309 respondents. Structural equation modelling analysis was conducted to examine the three levels of influential factors. These included self-perceptions of opinion leadership and seeking at the individual level, perceived tie strength and homophily at the network level, and finally, perceived news credibility and news preference at the news attribute level. Findings: The results revealed that the influences of self-perceptions of opinion leadership, perceived tie strength in online networks and perceived preference of online news had significant effects on users' news sharing intention in social media. However, self-perceptions of opinion seeking, homophily, and perceived news credibility were not significant. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies on news sharing in social media that focus on diverse levels of influential factors. In particular, the research suggests the viability of the diffusion of innovations theory to explain this pervasive global phenomenon.

example also being used for data mining and profiling, pre-recruiting
information as well as economic espionage. This review highlights
information privacy mainly from an individual point-of-view, focusing on
the usage of OSN sites (OSNs).
Findings - This analysis of scholarly work shows the following findings:
first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats
than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large
part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on
OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional
one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short. Hence, findings of this
paper further highlight the necessity to focus on multidimensional and
multidisciplinary frameworks of privacy, for example considering a
so-called ``privacy calculus paradigm{\{}''{\}} and rethinking ``fair
information practices{\{}''{\}} from a more and more ubiquitous environment of
OSNs.

18,{The 'urban age' in question},"Foreboding declarations about contemporary urban trends pervade early twenty-first century academic, political and journalistic discourse. Among the most widely recited is the claim that we now live in an 'urban age' because, for the first time in human history, more than half the world's population today purportedly lives within cities. Across otherwise diverse discursive, ideological and locational contexts, the urban age thesis has become a form of doxic common sense around which questions regarding the contemporary global urban condition are framed. This article argues that, despite its long history and its increasingly widespread influence, the urban age thesis is a flawed basis on which to conceptualize world urbanization patterns: it is empirically untenable (a statistical artifact) and theoretically incoherent (a chaotic conception). This critique is framed against the background of postwar attempts to measure the world's urban population, the main methodological and theoretical conundrums of which remain fundamentally unresolved in early twenty-first century urban age discourse. The article concludes by outlining a series of methodological perspectives for an alternative understanding of the contemporary global urban condition. {\textcopyright} 2013 Urban Research Publications Limited.",False,False,0,0,EXCLUDE,0,"**Decision:** EXCLUDE

19,{Slack: Adopting Social-Networking Platforms for Active Learning},"Online learning in postsecondary institutions has increased dramatically across the United States and Canada. Although research demonstrates the benefits of online learning for student success, instructors face challenges in facilitating communication, delivering course content, and navigating outdated and cumbersome technologies. The authors examine the use of a free third-party platform called Slack as a tool to facilitate better communication among students and faculty, enable the delivery of diverse and dynamic course content, and reach students in an online course that supports both independent and collaborative learning. The authors present a case study of Slack's use in an online second-year environmental politics course taught at a large Canadian public university. There is a significant and growing literature on how to best engage students in online learning, including active and social learning models as promising approaches to digital teaching. The authors argue that using collaborative social technologies such as Slack - which both replicates and integrates the online and social-media environments that students already inhabit - can assist faculty in meeting their pedagogical goals online. The article documents the instructors' experience in managing discussion and involving students in their online learning through active learning exercises.

20,{User-centered Design of Business Communities. The Influence of DIVERSity Factors on Motives to use Communities in Professional Settings},"The professional use and implementation of social media or social media related applications are booming. Solutions like business internal communities promise to connect employees in a more flexible way than old-fashioned mailing lists or static network drives ever could. New solutions are perceived to support communication independent from time and space and in allow a more flexible way of communicating direct as well as indirect through the offer of different communication media (chat, voice over IP, mail, blog, etc.). But in contrast to remarkably good application scenarios, reality is not keeping up. Therefore more investigations of usage conditions and acceptance parameters are needed to find out which showstoppers interfere with a successful implementation. Due to the fact that acceptance by future users is one core condition for a successful implementation of software within operational structures and processes, this paper presents a study with focus on motivational issues to use business communities depending on diversity factors. In this study the focus is set on the diversity factors age, gender, social media expertise, achievement motivation, and perceived locus of control over technology (ploc). First results revealed that the classical user diversity variables age and gender do not influence the motives to use business communities. In contrast technology related diversity factors and achievement motivation revealed correlations with usage motives (r {\textgreater}. 3). The most important motives were the need for information and autonomy. Achievement motivation showed the strongest correlation with the need for social interaction (r =. 51), indicating that highly motivated people can be motivated to use a SNS if it facilitates social interaction. {\textcopyright} 2015",False,False,0,0,EXCLUDE,0,"**Decision:** EXCLUDE

Intelligent management systems in operations: A review. J Oper Res Soc, 1998;49(7):682-99] although their implementation is not the first choice of many process engineers. In contrast process engineers in a diverse range of manufacturing environments regularly deploy business improvement techniques, such as the six-sigma methodology. Such techniques aim to control and subsequently identify the relationship between the process inputs and outputs so that a process engineer can more accurately predict how the process output shall perform based on the system inputs. Factors such as cost reduction, automatic process control or simply process prediction may be the defining factors in establishing prediction models. In this paper the authors use as a case study the manufacture of hard disc drives, from the developing of the read-write head to the recording media and the overall construction of the hard disc drive with its controlling mechanisms. Each of these stages are separate and complex-processing elements and integral to the functionality of the end product. In addition each of these stages of manufacturing may take days or weeks to complete and be processed in separate facilities and/or countries. This paper reports on the application of intelligent system techniques to improve the downstream performance prediction within this manufacturing environment. The application is guided by a six-sigma methodology to obtain improved performance. The results highlight that significant downstream prediction accuracy can be obtained using this hybrid approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

legislation that is dominated by a free market ideology does not prevent
the concentration of media capital. The process of media privatisation
takes different courses in print media and in broadcasting. The main
problems relate to (1)the non-transparency of privatisation processes,
(2) media as family business, (3) cross-media ownership, (4) the
impairment of public capital, (5) hostile take-overs. The authors
analyse five forms of media ownership concentration in Slovenia: (1)
chains - the same company owns more than the ``normal{\{}''{\}} number of
media of the same kind in the state; (2) networks - a holding company
produces programs and distributes them with the help of local stations
that are members of its network, but have their own legal independence;
(3) cross-media ownership - media companies include different kinds of
media in their portfolio; (4) conglomerates - corporations whose main
activity pertains to a different branch of the economy acquire a media
company; (5) vertical integration - mergers in programming production,
distribution, publishing activities, etc. Experiences with the

conducted on the Facebook social networking platform, in which
participants were asked about their own political attitudes, as well as
their beliefs about their friends' attitudes. Although considerable
attitude similarity exists among friends, the results show that friends
disagree more than they think they do. In particular, friends are
typically unaware of their disagreements, even when they say they
discuss the topic, suggesting that discussion is not the primary means
by which friends infer each other's views on particular issues. Rather,
it appears that respondents infer opinions in part by relying on
stereotypes of their friends and in part by projecting their own views.

24,{Typology of Web 2.0 spheres: Understanding the cultural dimensions of SOCIAL MEDIA spaces},"It has taken the past decade to commonly acknowledge that online space is tethered to real place. From euphoric conceptualizations of social media spaces as a novel, unprecedented and revolutionary entity, the dust has settled, allowing for talk of boundaries and ties to real-world settings. Metaphors have been instrumental in this pursuit, shaping perceptions and affecting actions within this extended structural realm. Specifically, they have been harnessed to architect Web 2.0 spaces, be it chatrooms, electronic frontiers, homepages, or information highways for policy and practice. While metaphors are pervasive in addressing and normalizing new media spaces, there is less effort channeled into organizing these digital domains along cultural lines to systematize and deepen understandings of its histories, agencies and communities. Hence, this article proposes a framework that reveals dominant cultural dimensions of Web 2.0 spaces through a five-fold typology: (1) utilitarian-driven, (2) aesthetic-driven, (3) context-driven, (4) play-driven and (5) value-driven.

The sampling technique was purposive, as it used the criteria of the academic community of Airlangga University that became an active member or often visited the homepage of the library's Twitter account at least three times in the past one month. The sample of this study was 220 respondents. Findings: The results of this study illustrate that the satisfaction of users of social networking Twitter library which includes surveillance, diversion/entertainment, personal identity and social relationship, either partially or simultaneously, affects the utilization of the college library. Originality/value: Based on these results, libraries should always provide services in accordance with the characteristics of user behavior.

SMIS engages central figures in online social networks to help recruit participants among visitors to these websites, yielding sizable samples for experimental research. We present data from six samples collected using the SMIS method and compare them to those gathered by other sampling approaches such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk. While not representative of the general adult population, our SMIS samples are significantly more diverse than undergraduate convenience samples, not only demographically but also politically. We discuss the applicability of the method to experimental research and its usefulness for obtaining samples of special, politically relevant subpopulations such as political sophisticates and activists. We argue that the diversity of SMIS samples, along with the ability to capture highly engaged citizens, can circumvent questions about the artificiality of political behavior experiments entirely based on student samples and help to document sources of heterogeneous experimental treatment effects. {\textcopyright} American Political Science Association 2013.",False,False,0,0,EXCLUDE,0,"**Decision:** EXCLUDE

more collaborative. As a result, collaboration with the right
individuals, teams, and institutions is increasingly crucial for
scientific progress. We propose Research Networking Systems (RNS) as a
new type of system designed to help scientists identify and choose
collaborators, and suggest a corresponding research agenda. The research
agenda covers four areas: foundations, presentation, architecture, and
evaluation. Foundations includes project-, institution- and
discipline-specific motivational factors; the role of social networks;
and impression formation based on information beyond expertise and
interests. Presentation addresses representing expertise in a
comprehensive and up-to-date manner; the role of controlled vocabularies
and folksonomies; the tension between seekers' need for comprehensive
information and potential collaborators' desire to control how they are
seen by others; and the need to support serendipitous discovery of
collaborative opportunities. Architecture considers aggregation and
synthesis of information from multiple sources, social system
interoperability, and integration with the user's primary work context.
Lastly, evaluation focuses on assessment of collaboration decisions,
measurement of user-specific costs and benefits, and how the large-scale
impact of RNS could be evaluated with longitudinal and naturalistic

The abstract lacks specific details about the methodology and the extent to which diversity is analyzed, necessitating a review of the full text to determine if it meets the inclusion criteria or violates any exclusion criteria.",004,LB,SYS_001,USR_003,gpt-4o,0.0,2025-08-13T15:04:34.414232
50,"{What SOCIAL MEDIA data should i use in my research?: A comparative analysis of TWITTER, youtube, REDDIT, and the new york times comments}","The emergence of popular social media allows people to generate and share information in unprecedented and multiple ways. While studies concerning social media data are plentiful and can be found across a variety of scholarly disciplines, there has been little research done that compares multiple social media while considering topics and goals of an investigation. We collected and analyzed comparable data from four different social media sources: Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and the New York Times website, across five research topics. We then analyzed these data sets across several criteria, such as richness and the diversity of information that they contain. Our analysis shows the trade-offs between different social media services and also provides a new framework to compare cross-platform data collection and analysis utility.

**Reasoning:** The abstract does not meet the inclusion criteria for the following reasons:

- **IC2**: The study focuses on social media platforms (Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and the New York Times comments), which could be considered media content. However, the abstract does not specify that it involves a media content or market analysis in the context of political communication.
  
- **IC3**: While the abstract mentions the ""diversity of information,"" it does not explicitly focus on diversity analysis in media as defined by the inclusion criteria (e.g., filter bubbles, echo chambers, pluralism, etc.). The diversity mentioned seems to be about the richness of data rather than media diversity.

The abstract also meets the following exclusion criteria:

- **EC5**: The mention of ""diversity of information"" is not in the context of media diversity analysis as required. It appears to be more about data characteristics rather than a focus on media diversity.

- **EC7**: The diversity reference is peripheral, as the primary focus is on comparing data from different social media platforms rather than analyzing media diversity.

Therefore, the abstract does not sufficiently align with the inclusion criteria and meets exclusion criteria, leading to the decision to exclude it from the review.",004,LB,SYS_001,USR_003,gpt-4o,0.0,2025-08-13T15:04:43.142051
